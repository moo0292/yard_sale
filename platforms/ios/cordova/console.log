He is a 2-3 yr old male Chihuahua, 7 pounds. Ricky is super sweet and loving toward all people and all dogs. He is super sweet, innocent, charming, loving, very submissive & already potty trained. He likes to crawl low to the ground, wagging his tail and giving kisses and giving belly to show people and other animals that he is being respectful, submissive and loving. Here are 2 video clips of him. \nhttp://youtu.be/PUvlhOWYBZg\nhttp://youtu.be/HmS8TtzmYaY\n\n Pic 2. ROMEO is Rickys twin brother and he is available for adoption. They do NOT need to be adopted together. Romeo is a lovebug also, and has the same sweet submissive personality. He is also already potty trained and he loves to give kisses.\n\n Pic 3.

I do my very best at walking on the leash next to daddy and try my best not to jump or run in front of 'mom' cause I don't want mommy to fall or  hurt her back...I am still learning some little stuff (like how to say out) but always come when my name is called.\n\nI luv my mommy & daddy so much that I pray this ad will bring another bro & sis into our family.

We haven't moved into the house yet but already paid our potion of this months rent plus the deposit. Our other roommate had family problems which caused him to back out at the last minute, so we are looking and looking fast for another roommate to take his place. The rent would be $950 PLUS utilities, a heavy price tag but keep in mind the location of this house.

The house is 1,100 square feet so it's not the biggest place but it has a very spacious backyard and patio. \n\nI am 25 years old and will be attending graduate school in Irvine. I have a super sweet Pitbull named Mosby. The other roommate is a friend of mine who is 26 and also has a very nice Pitbull named Toby, so whoever moves in will have to love dogs... Which wouldn't hard considering how awesome our little buddies are lol.

While looking for my new bro or sis,  I try to make them happy...doing tricks & warm their laps; even watching tv w/them. But its hard w/2 laps & 1 of me!\n\nLiving here is really GREAT, like after I learned to go potty outside they let me sleep in their bed, they take me on about 3-4x walks a day, go for drives, (sometimes to my favorite doggie park)!  We even play catch and rope a dope indoors. I do my very best at walking on the leash next to daddy and try my best not to jump or run in front of 'mom' cause I don't want mommy to fall or  hurt her back...I am still learning some little stuff (like how to say out) but always come when my name is called.\n\nI luv my mommy & daddy so much that I pray this ad will bring another bro & sis into our family.  Last thing, whoever comes need to be nonaggressive, mid to low energy (heck, their old), be pretty much potty trained and while helping protect, just not bark at every little noise..OH, gotta be between 6-10 lbs (mom's got something called screws in her back)Well....I said a lot but I love to help them so if you think you and I will get along (heck I'll even share my doggie beds), then contact them asap since they are very serious and more than ready....Thanks!!!!!

We haven't moved into the house yet but already paid our potion of this months rent plus the deposit. Our other roommate had family problems which caused him to back out at the last minute, so we are looking and looking fast for another roommate to take his place. The rent would be $950 PLUS utilities, a heavy price tag but keep in mind the location of this house. The roommate who is leaving is offered to leave his deposit so you would not have to be responsible for that. The house is 1,100 square feet so it's not the biggest place but it has a very spacious backyard and patio. \n\nI am 25 years old and will be attending graduate school in Irvine. I have a super sweet Pitbull named Mosby. The other roommate is a friend of mine who is 26 and also has a very nice Pitbull named Toby, so whoever moves in will have to love dogs... Which wouldn't hard considering how awesome our little buddies are lol. I will be coming to OC in about 2 weeks and would love to meet anyone interested in person, but before then please feel free to text or call me just so I know how many people are thinking about moving in with us! Here is a link to both of our Facebooks: \n\nJR Flores (mine): https://m.facebook.com/?_rdr#~!/jr.flores.3958?ref=bookmark\n\nJon (other roommate): https://m.facebook.com/home.php?refsrc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F&refid=8&_rdr#~!/jon.ho.7?ref=bookmark\n\nAlso, if you really are curious my instagram is jrfloresss. \n\nWe're both really laid back and fun guys. Not looking for a crazy party every weekend but at the same time always down to chill. Move in date is as soon as you want! So yeah anyone that is interested please text or call me. Guy or girl is fine, prefer ages 21 to mid 30's but as long as you're responsible and easy to get along with we could make it work. Hope to hear from many of you soon. Any questions, please ask!!!

We haven't moved into the house yet but already paid our potion of this months rent plus the deposit. Our other roommate had family problems which caused him to back out at the last minute, so we are looking and looking fast for another roommate to take his place. The rent would be $950 PLUS utilities, a heavy price tag but keep in mind the location of this house.

The house is 1,100 square feet so it's not the biggest place but it has a very spacious backyard and patio. \n\nI am 25 years old and will be attending graduate school in Irvine. I have a super sweet Pitbull named Mosby. The other roommate is a friend of mine who is 26 and also has a very nice Pitbull named Toby, so whoever moves in will have to love dogs... Which wouldn't hard considering how awesome our little buddies are lol.

While looking for my new bro or sis,  I try to make them happy...doing tricks & warm their laps; even watching tv w/them. But its hard w/2 laps & 1 of me!\n\nLiving here is really GREAT, like after I learned to go potty outside they let me sleep in their bed, they take me on about 3-4x walks a day, go for drives, (sometimes to my favorite doggie park)!  We even play catch and rope a dope indoors. I do my very best at walking on the leash next to daddy and try my best not to jump or run in front of 'mom' cause I don't want mommy to fall or  hurt her back...I am still learning some little stuff (like how to say out) but always come when my name is called.\n\nI luv my mommy & daddy so much that I pray this ad will bring another bro & sis into our family.  Last thing, whoever comes need to be nonaggressive, mid to low energy (heck, their old), be pretty much potty trained and while helping protect, just not bark at every little noise..OH, gotta be between 6-10 lbs (mom's got something called screws in her back)Well....I said a lot but I love to help them so if you think you and I will get along (heck I'll even share my doggie beds), then contact them asap since they are very serious and more than ready....Thanks!!!!!

We haven't moved into the house yet but already paid our potion of this months rent plus the deposit. Our other roommate had family problems which caused him to back out at the last minute, so we are looking and looking fast for another roommate to take his place. The rent would be $950 PLUS utilities, a heavy price tag but keep in mind the location of this house. The roommate who is leaving is offered to leave his deposit so you would not have to be responsible for that. The house is 1,100 square feet so it's not the biggest place but it has a very spacious backyard and patio. \n\nI am 25 years old and will be attending graduate school in Irvine. I have a super sweet Pitbull named Mosby. The other roommate is a friend of mine who is 26 and also has a very nice Pitbull named Toby, so whoever moves in will have to love dogs... Which wouldn't hard considering how awesome our little buddies are lol. I will be coming to OC in about 2 weeks and would love to meet anyone interested in person, but before then please feel free to text or call me just so I know how many people are thinking about moving in with us! Here is a link to both of our Facebooks: \n\nJR Flores (mine): https://m.facebook.com/?_rdr#~!/jr.flores.3958?ref=bookmark\n\nJon (other roommate): https://m.facebook.com/home.php?refsrc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F&refid=8&_rdr#~!/jon.ho.7?ref=bookmark\n\nAlso, if you really are curious my instagram is jrfloresss. \n\nWe're both really laid back and fun guys. Not looking for a crazy party every weekend but at the same time always down to chill. Move in date is as soon as you want! So yeah anyone that is interested please text or call me. Guy or girl is fine, prefer ages 21 to mid 30's but as long as you're responsible and easy to get along with we could make it work. Hope to hear from many of you soon. Any questions, please ask!!!

We haven't moved into the house yet but already paid our potion of this months rent plus the deposit. Our other roommate had family problems which caused him to back out at the last minute, so we are looking and looking fast for another roommate to take his place. The rent would be $950 PLUS utilities, a heavy price tag but keep in mind the location of this house.

The house is 1,100 square feet so it's not the biggest place but it has a very spacious backyard and patio. \n\nI am 25 years old and will be attending graduate school in Irvine. I have a super sweet Pitbull named Mosby. The other roommate is a friend of mine who is 26 and also has a very nice Pitbull named Toby, so whoever moves in will have to love dogs... Which wouldn't hard considering how awesome our little buddies are lol.

While looking for my new bro or sis,  I try to make them happy...doing tricks & warm their laps; even watching tv w/them. But its hard w/2 laps & 1 of me!\n\nLiving here is really GREAT, like after I learned to go potty outside they let me sleep in their bed, they take me on about 3-4x walks a day, go for drives, (sometimes to my favorite doggie park)!  We even play catch and rope a dope indoors. I do my very best at walking on the leash next to daddy and try my best not to jump or run in front of 'mom' cause I don't want mommy to fall or  hurt her back...I am still learning some little stuff (like how to say out) but always come when my name is called.\n\nI luv my mommy & daddy so much that I pray this ad will bring another bro & sis into our family.  Last thing, whoever comes need to be nonaggressive, mid to low energy (heck, their old), be pretty much potty trained and while helping protect, just not bark at every little noise..OH, gotta be between 6-10 lbs (mom's got something called screws in her back)Well....I said a lot but I love to help them so if you think you and I will get along (heck I'll even share my doggie beds), then contact them asap since they are very serious and more than ready....Thanks!!!!!

We haven't moved into the house yet but already paid our potion of this months rent plus the deposit. Our other roommate had family problems which caused him to back out at the last minute, so we are looking and looking fast for another roommate to take his place. The rent would be $950 PLUS utilities, a heavy price tag but keep in mind the location of this house. The roommate who is leaving is offered to leave his deposit so you would not have to be responsible for that. The house is 1,100 square feet so it's not the biggest place but it has a very spacious backyard and patio. \n\nI am 25 years old and will be attending graduate school in Irvine. I have a super sweet Pitbull named Mosby. The other roommate is a friend of mine who is 26 and also has a very nice Pitbull named Toby, so whoever moves in will have to love dogs... Which wouldn't hard considering how awesome our little buddies are lol. I will be coming to OC in about 2 weeks and would love to meet anyone interested in person, but before then please feel free to text or call me just so I know how many people are thinking about moving in with us! Here is a link to both of our Facebooks: \n\nJR Flores (mine): https://m.facebook.com/?_rdr#~!/jr.flores.3958?ref=bookmark\n\nJon (other roommate): https://m.facebook.com/home.php?refsrc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F&refid=8&_rdr#~!/jon.ho.7?ref=bookmark\n\nAlso, if you really are curious my instagram is jrfloresss. \n\nWe're both really laid back and fun guys. Not looking for a crazy party every weekend but at the same time always down to chill. Move in date is as soon as you want! So yeah anyone that is interested please text or call me. Guy or girl is fine, prefer ages 21 to mid 30's but as long as you're responsible and easy to get along with we could make it work. Hope to hear from many of you soon. Any questions, please ask!!!

We haven't moved into the house yet but already paid our potion of this months rent plus the deposit. Our other roommate had family problems which caused him to back out at the last minute, so we are looking and looking fast for another roommate to take his place. The rent would be $950 PLUS utilities, a heavy price tag but keep in mind the location of this house.

The house is 1,100 square feet so it's not the biggest place but it has a very spacious backyard and patio. \n\nI am 25 years old and will be attending graduate school in Irvine. I have a super sweet Pitbull named Mosby. The other roommate is a friend of mine who is 26 and also has a very nice Pitbull named Toby, so whoever moves in will have to love dogs... Which wouldn't hard considering how awesome our little buddies are lol.

While looking for my new bro or sis,  I try to make them happy...doing tricks & warm their laps; even watching tv w/them. But its hard w/2 laps & 1 of me!\n\nLiving here is really GREAT, like after I learned to go potty outside they let me sleep in their bed, they take me on about 3-4x walks a day, go for drives, (sometimes to my favorite doggie park)!  We even play catch and rope a dope indoors. I do my very best at walking on the leash next to daddy and try my best not to jump or run in front of 'mom' cause I don't want mommy to fall or  hurt her back...I am still learning some little stuff (like how to say out) but always come when my name is called.\n\nI luv my mommy & daddy so much that I pray this ad will bring another bro & sis into our family.  Last thing, whoever comes need to be nonaggressive, mid to low energy (heck, their old), be pretty much potty trained and while helping protect, just not bark at every little noise..OH, gotta be between 6-10 lbs (mom's got something called screws in her back)Well....I said a lot but I love to help them so if you think you and I will get along (heck I'll even share my doggie beds), then contact them asap since they are very serious and more than ready....Thanks!!!!!

We haven't moved into the house yet but already paid our potion of this months rent plus the deposit. Our other roommate had family problems which caused him to back out at the last minute, so we are looking and looking fast for another roommate to take his place. The rent would be $950 PLUS utilities, a heavy price tag but keep in mind the location of this house. The roommate who is leaving is offered to leave his deposit so you would not have to be responsible for that. The house is 1,100 square feet so it's not the biggest place but it has a very spacious backyard and patio. \n\nI am 25 years old and will be attending graduate school in Irvine. I have a super sweet Pitbull named Mosby. The other roommate is a friend of mine who is 26 and also has a very nice Pitbull named Toby, so whoever moves in will have to love dogs... Which wouldn't hard considering how awesome our little buddies are lol. I will be coming to OC in about 2 weeks and would love to meet anyone interested in person, but before then please feel free to text or call me just so I know how many people are thinking about moving in with us! Here is a link to both of our Facebooks: \n\nJR Flores (mine): https://m.facebook.com/?_rdr#~!/jr.flores.3958?ref=bookmark\n\nJon (other roommate): https://m.facebook.com/home.php?refsrc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F&refid=8&_rdr#~!/jon.ho.7?ref=bookmark\n\nAlso, if you really are curious my instagram is jrfloresss. \n\nWe're both really laid back and fun guys. Not looking for a crazy party every weekend but at the same time always down to chill. Move in date is as soon as you want! So yeah anyone that is interested please text or call me. Guy or girl is fine, prefer ages 21 to mid 30's but as long as you're responsible and easy to get along with we could make it work. Hope to hear from many of you soon. Any questions, please ask!!!

We haven't moved into the house yet but already paid our potion of this months rent plus the deposit. Our other roommate had family problems which caused him to back out at the last minute, so we are looking and looking fast for another roommate to take his place. The rent would be $950 PLUS utilities, a heavy price tag but keep in mind the location of this house.

The house is 1,100 square feet so it's not the biggest place but it has a very spacious backyard and patio. \n\nI am 25 years old and will be attending graduate school in Irvine. I have a super sweet Pitbull named Mosby. The other roommate is a friend of mine who is 26 and also has a very nice Pitbull named Toby, so whoever moves in will have to love dogs... Which wouldn't hard considering how awesome our little buddies are lol. I will be coming to OC in about 2 weeks and would love to meet anyone interested in person, but before then please feel free to text or call me just so I know how many people are thinking about moving in with us!

He is a 2-3 yr old male Chihuahua, 7 pounds. Ricky is super sweet and loving toward all people and all dogs. He is super sweet, innocent, charming, loving, very submissive & already potty trained. He likes to crawl low to the ground, wagging his tail and giving kisses and giving belly to show people and other animals that he is being respectful, submissive and loving. Here are 2 video clips of him. \nhttp://youtu.be/PUvlhOWYBZg\nhttp://youtu.be/HmS8TtzmYaY\n\n Pic 2. ROMEO is Rickys twin brother and he is available for adoption.

I do my very best at walking on the leash next to daddy and try my best not to jump or run in front of 'mom' cause I don't want mommy to fall or  hurt her back...I am still learning some little stuff (like how to say out) but always come when my name is called.\n\nI luv my mommy & daddy so much that I pray this ad will bring another bro & sis into our family.

We haven't moved into the house yet but already paid our potion of this months rent plus the deposit. Our other roommate had family problems which caused him to back out at the last minute, so we are looking and looking fast for another roommate to take his place. The rent would be $950 PLUS utilities, a heavy price tag but keep in mind the location of this house. The roommate who is leaving is offered to leave his deposit so you would not have to be responsible for that. The house is 1,100 square feet so it's not the biggest place but it has a very spacious backyard and patio. \n\nI am 25 years old and will be attending graduate school in Irvine. I have a super sweet Pitbull named Mosby. The other roommate is a friend of mine who is 26 and also has a very nice Pitbull named Toby, so whoever moves in will have to love dogs... Which wouldn't hard considering how awesome our little buddies are lol. I will be coming to OC in about 2 weeks and would love to meet anyone interested in person, but before then please feel free to text or call me just so I know how many people are thinking about moving in with us! Here is a link to both of our Facebooks: \n\nJR Flores (mine): https://m.facebook.com/?_rdr#~!/jr.flores.3958?ref=bookmark\n\nJon (other roommate): https://m.facebook.com/home.php?refsrc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F&refid=8&_rdr#~!/jon.ho.7?ref=bookmark\n\nAlso, if you really are curious my instagram is jrfloresss. \n\nWe're both really laid back and fun guys. Not looking for a crazy party every weekend but at the same time always down to chill. Move in date is as soon as you want! So yeah anyone that is interested please text or call me. Guy or girl is fine, prefer ages 21 to mid 30's but as long as you're responsible and easy to get along with we could make it work. Hope to hear from many of you soon. Any questions, please ask!!!

We haven't moved into the house yet but already paid our potion of this months rent plus the deposit. Our other roommate had family problems which caused him to back out at the last minute, so we are looking and looking fast for another roommate to take his place. The rent would be $950 PLUS utilities, a heavy price tag but keep in mind the location of this house.

The house is 1,100 square feet so it's not the biggest place but it has a very spacious backyard and patio. \n\nI am 25 years old and will be attending graduate school in Irvine. I have a super sweet Pitbull named Mosby. The other roommate is a friend of mine who is 26 and also has a very nice Pitbull named Toby, so whoever moves in will have to love dogs... Which wouldn't hard considering how awesome our little buddies are lol. I will be coming to OC in about 2 weeks and would love to meet anyone interested in person, but before then please feel free to text or call me just so I know how many people are thinking about moving in with us!

While looking for my new bro or sis,  I try to make them happy...doing tricks & warm their laps; even watching tv w/them. But its hard w/2 laps & 1 of me!\n\nLiving here is really GREAT, like after I learned to go potty outside they let me sleep in their bed, they take me on about 3-4x walks a day, go for drives, (sometimes to my favorite doggie park)!  We even play catch and rope a dope indoors. I do my very best at walking on the leash next to daddy and try my best not to jump or run in front of 'mom' cause I don't want mommy to fall or  hurt her back...I am still learning some little stuff (like how to say out) but always come when my name is called.\n\nI luv my mommy & daddy so much that I pray this ad will bring another bro & sis into our family.  Last thing, whoever comes need to be nonaggressive, mid to low energy (heck, their old), be pretty much potty trained and while helping protect, just not bark at every little noise..OH, gotta be between 6-10 lbs (mom's got something called screws in her back)Well....I said a lot but I love to help them so if you think you and I will get along (heck I'll even share my doggie beds), then contact them asap since they are very serious and more than ready....Thanks!!!!!

We haven't moved into the house yet but already paid our potion of this months rent plus the deposit. Our other roommate had family problems which caused him to back out at the last minute, so we are looking and looking fast for another roommate to take his place. The rent would be $950 PLUS utilities, a heavy price tag but keep in mind the location of this house. The roommate who is leaving is offered to leave his deposit so you would not have to be responsible for that. The house is 1,100 square feet so it's not the biggest place but it has a very spacious backyard and patio. \n\nI am 25 years old and will be attending graduate school in Irvine. I have a super sweet Pitbull named Mosby. The other roommate is a friend of mine who is 26 and also has a very nice Pitbull named Toby, so whoever moves in will have to love dogs... Which wouldn't hard considering how awesome our little buddies are lol. I will be coming to OC in about 2 weeks and would love to meet anyone interested in person, but before then please feel free to text or call me just so I know how many people are thinking about moving in with us! Here is a link to both of our Facebooks: \n\nJR Flores (mine): https://m.facebook.com/?_rdr#~!/jr.flores.3958?ref=bookmark\n\nJon (other roommate): https://m.facebook.com/home.php?refsrc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F&refid=8&_rdr#~!/jon.ho.7?ref=bookmark\n\nAlso, if you really are curious my instagram is jrfloresss. \n\nWe're both really laid back and fun guys. Not looking for a crazy party every weekend but at the same time always down to chill. Move in date is as soon as you want! So yeah anyone that is interested please text or call me. Guy or girl is fine, prefer ages 21 to mid 30's but as long as you're responsible and easy to get along with we could make it work. Hope to hear from many of you soon. Any questions, please ask!!!

I do my very best at walking on the leash next to daddy and try my best not to jump or run in front of 'mom' cause I don't want mommy to fall or  hurt her back...I am still learning some little stuff (like how to say out) but always come when my name is called.\n\nI luv my mommy & daddy so much that I pray this ad will bring another bro & sis into our family.

We haven't moved into the house yet but already paid our potion of this months rent plus the deposit. Our other roommate had family problems which caused him to back out at the last minute, so we are looking and looking fast for another roommate to take his place. The rent would be $950 PLUS utilities, a heavy price tag but keep in mind the location of this house. The roommate who is leaving is offered to leave his deposit so you would not have to be responsible for that. The house is 1,100 square feet so it's not the biggest place but it has a very spacious backyard and patio. \n\nI am 25 years old and will be attending graduate school in Irvine. I have a super sweet Pitbull named Mosby. The other roommate is a friend of mine who is 26 and also has a very nice Pitbull named Toby, so whoever moves in will have to love dogs... Which wouldn't hard considering how awesome our little buddies are lol. I will be coming to OC in about 2 weeks and would love to meet anyone interested in person, but before then please feel free to text or call me just so I know how many people are thinking about moving in with us! Here is a link to both of our Facebooks: \n\nJR Flores (mine): https://m.facebook.com/?_rdr#~!/jr.flores.3958?ref=bookmark\n\nJon (other roommate): https://m.facebook.com/home.php?refsrc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F&refid=8&_rdr#~!/jon.ho.7?ref=bookmark\n\nAlso, if you really are curious my instagram is jrfloresss. \n\nWe're both really laid back and fun guys.

Fostering is free and we pay the vet bills. Then you get first dibs at adopting that dog. All dogs are neutered, up to date with shots, and have registered microchips. \n\n Pic 1: RICKY is available for adoption or to FOSTER. He is the best dog ever!! He is a 2-3 yr old male Chihuahua, 7 pounds. Ricky is super sweet and loving toward all people and all dogs. He is super sweet, innocent, charming, loving, very submissive & already potty trained. He likes to crawl low to the ground, wagging his tail and giving kisses and giving belly to show people and other animals that he is being respectful, submissive and loving. Here are 2 video clips of him. \nhttp://youtu.be/PUvlhOWYBZg\nhttp://youtu.be/HmS8TtzmYaY\n\n Pic 2. ROMEO is Rickys twin brother and he is available for adoption. They do NOT need to be adopted together. Romeo is a lovebug also, and has the same sweet submissive personality. He is also already potty trained and he loves to give kisses.\n\n Pic 3. RED is a 10-12 yr old senior estimated at 8-10 pounds. Red is not available YET but we want to line up a FOSTER home for him. Red is on an evidence hold at a shelter in a cruelty case against his former owner. We have committed to him and are in need of someone who loves senior dogs enough that you would be willing to be on standby and wait for him until they release him. We believe Red is a longharied daschund or Chihuahua with a little bit of Pomeranian or spaniel in him.\n\n Pic 4: BABY- 3.5 month old Chihuahua 1.5 pounds. Baby is in the same situation as Red. We are in need of someone willing to be on standby and FOSTER him immediately upon his release from evidence hold.

It features the advanced decoding circuitry (Dolby Digital, Pro Logic II, EX, DTS Digital Surround, Matrix 6, Neo:6) required to provide high-quality audio with extreme accuracy. It also uses integrated amplifiers to deliver approximately 110W to each channel, and Yamaha's proprietary Tri-Field Processing engine to ensure every Decibel is optimized for a true movie-theater experience. In fact, many reviewers have pointed out that the RX-V2300 produces high-quality audio right out the box-without any adjusted settings. However, the on-screen display (described as a bit complicated) offers several key functionalities for even better audio, including all-channel stereo DSP for a 6-speaker system, virtual cinema dsp for a two-stereo setup, and silent cinema specifically for 2-channel headphones.

This apartment is very new; I am the first person to live here since it was built, about 1 year. \n\nIt's a great apartment with very private views --- the balcony faces the backside parking lot and bedroom windows face the awesome trail behind Umbria apartments. So this means you don't see into other people's apartments, and no apartments can see into yours.\n\nGreat neighbors (very, very quiet) and just an amazing place to live. If I wasn't moving into a home I would stay here.\n\nThrough the leasing office the apartment is currently listed at $1795 which is A HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE than my current lease, $1695. This is a great deal; you save $100 a month for a great apartment, and there is about 10 months left on the lease.\n\n\nRESIDENCE FEATURES\nPrivate garage w/ remote, some with direct access*\nHardwood-style flooring throughout entry, kitchen, living & dining room\nFully-equipped kitchens with refrigerator with ice-maker, microwave, oven & dishwasher\nQuartz Stone countertops in kitchen and bath\nKitchen w/ white shaker panel cabinetry w/ rod pulls & recessed lighting\nIn home washer/dryer\n2\" Mini blinds\nWalk-In closets* or mirrored closet doors\nHigh-efficiency central heating /air conditioning\nIn-home Alarm System w/optional monitoring\nDigital/Cable TV Ready\nWired for High Speed Internet/multiple phone lines\nSmoke-free residences*\nPet friendly with dogs up to 21 inches welcome*\n\nCOMMUNITY AMENITIES\nResort-style saltwater pool, spa, poolside cabanas\nOutdoor fireplace & several BBQ areas\nWi-Fi Access in common areas*\nInternet Café with access to a MacBook, open lounging, and a multi-function printer\nSpacious clubroom with gourmet kitchen, pool table, shuffle board, plasma TV and outdoor terrace w/ dining tables\nCardio Theater fitness center with free weights and strength equipment with 24 hour access\nAccess to future community park will include ball fields, tennis/basketball courts & tot lot\nCentrally located to Irvine biking trails\n* In select floor plans/residences\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T17:46:27.078Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_3qsIZ5md5Ja_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01414_ceKKS2ToKIg_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_k8JTgqFgZpM_600x450.jpg"],"$$hashKey":"00P"},{"_id":"53e269f3df4a4a000043660e","name":"Taking Reservations for Spring 2015 Semester","weblink":"http://orangecounty.craigslist.org//apa/4606020781.html","price":"$1300","category":"Apartment","detail":"\n        University Crossings Apartments, managed by AMC\n2404 Nutwood Avenue\nFullerton, CA 92831\n show contact info\n\n\n\nOur residents have full access and are encouraged to take advantage of our Tropical Style Pool with Fire Pit and Music, State of the art Fitness Center, Business Lounge, and Free Wi-Fi in our clubhouse. \n\nBrand new cabinets, kitchen appliance package, fully renovated and more. \n\nApartment Features\n* Air Conditioning\n* Linen Closet\n* Vertical Blinds\n* Refrigerator, Microwave, Dishwasher & Gas Stove\n* Roommate Friendly Floor Plan\n* Pre-wired for internet and cable\n* Ceiling Fan\n\n[#1116622]\n\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T17:46:27.078Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_3wEdf5dsygT_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00v0v_2fEsMLard2_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00202_ka4vLcbq9Xi_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00s0s_kcEgoeqTTLt_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00000_jMngluPUf2t_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00T0T_lRvDiYulIu_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00D0D_h63QecUCRzR_600x450.jpg"],"$$hashKey":"00Q"},{"_id":"53e269f3df4a4a000043660b","name":"Great Studio Available in Sunny Mission Viejo!

Blackberry is super sweet and playful, however she can be a bit shy at first until she gets to know you and a level of trust is established. Based on her body type, she looks like a Belgian hare. Watching them snuggle and play together is a joy, and their antics will have you laughing.

I have had her since I was 18 and she was a puppy (I am now 26) and she was the best little companion ever. I had just moved out and needed a friend. I found her living in a room with 3 other toy breeds destroying a roommates room. I \"requested\" she was given to me. She was my best friend. Prissy went everywhere with me. I even had her trained to hop in a litter box and use the bathroom on a puppy pad while I was at work.\n\nA few years later, I was moving out of California and was having difficulty bringing her. This happened to be around the time my families chihuahua had been put down due to old age. So I gave her to my little brother who was very sad about loosing his dog. This way I would still be able to see her and know she is being taken care of. \n\nShe stayed with my family for about 5 years. They fell in love with her (especially my little brother). She was spoiled and given soft food and table scraps (causing her to get major build up and a rotten mouth). She had also gained a few pounds (which for her tiny size is very noticeable).\n\nIn the middle of those 5 years, my parents ended up getting a divorce and poor little Prissy went from having a house with her own backyard, to a small 2 bedroom apartment. She didn't understand what was going on. She went from having a back yard to run in and out of all day to use the bathroom, to being confined to a small apartment, waiting for someone to come home from work or school to take her out. Naturally, this didn't work out too well. \n\nPrissy ended up using the bathroom all over the apartment and becoming hyper sensitive to every noise she heard outside, causing her to bark. I got a call saying they couldn't deal with her any more. So of course I came and got her. \n\nI got her eating right and back to a healthy weight, as well as using puppy pads while I was at work. She seemed to be getting back on track (despite her new barking habit). I was happy to have her back. She is the sweetest little thing. Loves to just cuddle up in your lap or press her body against your face requesting kisses. I quickly noticed how bad her breath was. \n\nWhen I took her to the vet, they told me that pretty much all her teeth are rotten. She would need to be put under anesthesia and have her teeth cleaned and most of her teeth would fall out during the process. The vet said it was due to years of her eating soft food and table scraps at my families house. I felt horrible for her. They told me it would be around $400 for the whole procedure. I did not have the money. Couple weeks later, she ended up rupturing an anal gland. I ended up having to spend $250 for medication and diapers to keep it sanitary. \n\nI don't know what is going on with her, but she has again stopped using puppy pads. I take her out and she uses the bathroom numerous times, but still comes inside and finds a corner to pee in. I don't get it. Maybe she is just getting old? Or since she is back to living in a house, she forgets where the puppy pads are? I don't know. When we lived in an apartment, she had no problem using the puppy pads. She also barks whenever she hears another dog outside or a person talking. My neighbors are beginning to complain. \n\nI love this lil lady so much, but I have come to the conclusion that it might be best for her to find a new home. Preferably a single older person with no kids and has time to be home with her the majority of the day so she has someone to cuddle and take her out. She was kept in solitary confinement for so many years with my family, that she now is very easily excited when being walked and wants to run after any and everything. She is a very spry little old lady. Does not act at all like a middle aged dog. She is constantly wanting to run and play when she is not cuddled up with you on the couch. You would think she was still a puppy the way she runs and plays. \n\n\n\n\n\nShe just needs someone who is calm and lives a quiet life somewhere with little to no noise. She would be perfect for and elderly woman in need of a companion. She is full of love and deserves a nice quiet life with someone who can take care of her teeth and give her tons of love and affection. She is about 8 years old (and I'm sure will live to be at least 16), and about 3lbs. Your hand is about the size of her whole body. She is a healthy little playful girl with a sassy attitude. At first, she doesn't seem to like company, but after they have sat down she is fine. She seems to feel intimidated when people are standing. She isn't aggressive, just talkative. Prissy is fixed as well. \n\nHer breed is pretty rare. Everyone thinks she is a chihuahua/min pin. But through research, I found out she is a Russian toy terrier. \n\nI am asking a small rehoming fee (100) so I feel confident in knowing you would be able to take care of her and her needs as she gets older. As of now, all she needs is her teethe removed. Other than that, she has the body and mind of a puppy. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read Prissy's story. If you would like to know anything else, or want more pics, feel free to send me an email. \n\nI am going to be picky about who takes her. So please be sure to read her story before messaging me. \n\n\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T17:41:32.987Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/00808_w3xsZDdpDW_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01717_fIoz9nbSNL_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_kN2cOH2oOzw_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_fl6FAHrNQoQ_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_grTlUsMakT3_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00f0f_bD4bsb9dbA6_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00G0G_7qk5fRjS9cs_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00d0d_6JQx0UABpYz_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00E0E_iBAaWkBsVbB_600x450.jpg"],"$$hashKey":"03E"},{"_id":"53e268cc95d55f0000c2c8a7","name":"I have two dogs n love bird n parakeets","weblink":"http://orangecounty.craigslist.org//pet/4605303574.html","price":"","category":"Pet","email":"wjcw8-4605303574@comm.craigslist.org","detail":"\n        I have an albino white red nose pit and a bully black and white both have all there shots both good around kids I have had them since puppy's around my daughters I have an apt now so I can't keep them I want them to go to a good loving home both together they can have puppies still I haven't had none yet tho small rehoming fee of 125 to make sure they go to good home not fighting dogs please \n\nAlso have a blue love bird with cage I want 50 for it \nAlso have 3 parakeets with cage I want 50 for them \nThanks please text me at\n show contact info\nalbert\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T17:41:32.987Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/00y0y_hM8gwPjI89A_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01616_hStHMWuYEhT_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00x0x_kYPXEdK7twC_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00303_3eEZGp3aZgg_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00606_732UPbBsPGJ_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00d0d_1W8UhBd7LQi_600x450.jpg"],"$$hashKey":"040"},{"_id":"53e268cc95d55f0000c2c8a5","name":"Fun and Free Community Dog Walk","weblink":"http://orangecounty.craigslist.org//pet/4598182088.html","price":"","category":"Pet","email":"5gvzs-4598182088@comm.craigslist.org","detail":"\n        Does your dog need to socialize more?

It features the advanced decoding circuitry (Dolby Digital, Pro Logic II, EX, DTS Digital Surround, Matrix 6, Neo:6) required to provide high-quality audio with extreme accuracy. It also uses integrated amplifiers to deliver approximately 110W to each channel, and Yamaha's proprietary Tri-Field Processing engine to ensure every Decibel is optimized for a true movie-theater experience. In fact, many reviewers have pointed out that the RX-V2300 produces high-quality audio right out the box-without any adjusted settings. However, the on-screen display (described as a bit complicated) offers several key functionalities for even better audio, including all-channel stereo DSP for a 6-speaker system, virtual cinema dsp for a two-stereo setup, and silent cinema specifically for 2-channel headphones. Additional features include an onboard tuner, an RS-232 interface for connecting to multi-room controllers, and downscaling-conversion (s-video to composite) for switching between sources without having to adjust inputs on the TV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T18:05:05.798Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/01212_2rQDS2Q04FP_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00u0u_PuuBtSYxtP_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01717_70AUKDPn1yk_600x450.jpg"],"$$hashKey":"02Y"},{"_id":"53e26e51c1361800008300a5","name":"HDTV's - Let The \"New Year\" Begin With A \"Big Screen\" TV!!

This apartment is very new; I am the first person to live here since it was built, about 1 year. \n\nIt's a great apartment with very private views --- the balcony faces the backside parking lot and bedroom windows face the awesome trail behind Umbria apartments. So this means you don't see into other people's apartments, and no apartments can see into yours.\n\nGreat neighbors (very, very quiet) and just an amazing place to live. If I wasn't moving into a home I would stay here.\n\nThrough the leasing office the apartment is currently listed at $1795 which is A HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE than my current lease, $1695.

We accomplish this via our web site, through referrals and by holding adoption events at pet stores such as PETCO and PetSmart.  Additionally, we post profiles of the adoptable rabbits on web sites such as Petfinder.com and BunSpace.com. The Sweetpea Foundation makes every effort to educate adopting and fostering families about the care of rabbits.

","weblink":"http://orangecounty.craigslist.org//pet/4605252852.html","price":"","category":"Pet","email":"9gmw4-4605252852@comm.craigslist.org","detail":"\n        I am sad to say, my little lady (Prissy) needs a new home. I have had her since I was 18 and she was a puppy (I am now 26) and she was the best little companion ever. I had just moved out and needed a friend. I found her living in a room with 3 other toy breeds destroying a roommates room. I \"requested\" she was given to me. She was my best friend. Prissy went everywhere with me. I even had her trained to hop in a litter box and use the bathroom on a puppy pad while I was at work.\n\nA few years later, I was moving out of California and was having difficulty bringing her. This happened to be around the time my families chihuahua had been put down due to old age. So I gave her to my little brother who was very sad about loosing his dog. This way I would still be able to see her and know she is being taken care of. \n\nShe stayed with my family for about 5 years. They fell in love with her (especially my little brother). She was spoiled and given soft food and table scraps (causing her to get major build up and a rotten mouth). She had also gained a few pounds (which for her tiny size is very noticeable).\n\nIn the middle of those 5 years, my parents ended up getting a divorce and poor little Prissy went from having a house with her own backyard, to a small 2 bedroom apartment. She didn't understand what was going on. She went from having a back yard to run in and out of all day to use the bathroom, to being confined to a small apartment, waiting for someone to come home from work or school to take her out. Naturally, this didn't work out too well. \n\nPrissy ended up using the bathroom all over the apartment and becoming hyper sensitive to every noise she heard outside, causing her to bark. I got a call saying they couldn't deal with her any more. So of course I came and got her. \n\nI got her eating right and back to a healthy weight, as well as using puppy pads while I was at work. She seemed to be getting back on track (despite her new barking habit). I was happy to have her back. She is the sweetest little thing. Loves to just cuddle up in your lap or press her body against your face requesting kisses. I quickly noticed how bad her breath was. \n\nWhen I took her to the vet, they told me that pretty much all her teeth are rotten. She would need to be put under anesthesia and have her teeth cleaned and most of her teeth would fall out during the process. The vet said it was due to years of her eating soft food and table scraps at my families house. I felt horrible for her. They told me it would be around $400 for the whole procedure. I did not have the money. Couple weeks later, she ended up rupturing an anal gland. I ended up having to spend $250 for medication and diapers to keep it sanitary. \n\nI don't know what is going on with her, but she has again stopped using puppy pads. I take her out and she uses the bathroom numerous times, but still comes inside and finds a corner to pee in. I don't get it. Maybe she is just getting old? Or since she is back to living in a house, she forgets where the puppy pads are? I don't know. When we lived in an apartment, she had no problem using the puppy pads. She also barks whenever she hears another dog outside or a person talking. My neighbors are beginning to complain. \n\nI love this lil lady so much, but I have come to the conclusion that it might be best for her to find a new home. Preferably a single older person with no kids and has time to be home with her the majority of the day so she has someone to cuddle and take her out. She was kept in solitary confinement for so many years with my family, that she now is very easily excited when being walked and wants to run after any and everything. She is a very spry little old lady. Does not act at all like a middle aged dog. She is constantly wanting to run and play when she is not cuddled up with you on the couch. You would think she was still a puppy the way she runs and plays. \n\n\n\n\n\nShe just needs someone who is calm and lives a quiet life somewhere with little to no noise. She would be perfect for and elderly woman in need of a companion. She is full of love and deserves a nice quiet life with someone who can take care of her teeth and give her tons of love and affection. She is about 8 years old (and I'm sure will live to be at least 16), and about 3lbs. Your hand is about the size of her whole body. She is a healthy little playful girl with a sassy attitude. At first, she doesn't seem to like company, but after they have sat down she is fine. She seems to feel intimidated when people are standing. She isn't aggressive, just talkative. Prissy is fixed as well. \n\nHer breed is pretty rare. Everyone thinks she is a chihuahua/min pin. But through research, I found out she is a Russian toy terrier. \n\nI am asking a small rehoming fee (100) so I feel confident in knowing you would be able to take care of her and her needs as she gets older. As of now, all she needs is her teethe removed. Other than that, she has the body and mind of a puppy. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read Prissy's story. If you would like to know anything else, or want more pics, feel free to send me an email. \n\nI am going to be picky about who takes her. So please be sure to read her story before messaging me. \n\n\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T17:41:32.987Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/00808_w3xsZDdpDW_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01717_fIoz9nbSNL_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_kN2cOH2oOzw_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_fl6FAHrNQoQ_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_grTlUsMakT3_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00f0f_bD4bsb9dbA6_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00G0G_7qk5fRjS9cs_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00d0d_6JQx0UABpYz_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00E0E_iBAaWkBsVbB_600x450.jpg"]},{"_id":"53e268cc95d55f0000c2c8a7","name":"I have two dogs n love bird n parakeets","weblink":"http://orangecounty.craigslist.org//pet/4605303574.html","price":"","category":"Pet","email":"wjcw8-4605303574@comm.craigslist.org","detail":"\n        I have an albino white red nose pit and a bully black and white both have all there shots both good around kids I have had them since puppy's around my daughters I have an apt now so I can't keep them I want them to go to a good loving home both together they can have puppies still I haven't had none yet tho small rehoming fee of 125 to make sure they go to good home not fighting dogs please \n\nAlso have a blue love bird with cage I want 50 for it \nAlso have 3 parakeets with cage I want 50 for them \nThanks please text me at\n show contact info\nalbert\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T17:41:32.987Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/00y0y_hM8gwPjI89A_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01616_hStHMWuYEhT_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00x0x_kYPXEdK7twC_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00303_3eEZGp3aZgg_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00606_732UPbBsPGJ_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00d0d_1W8UhBd7LQi_600x450.jpg"]},{"_id":"53e268cc95d55f0000c2c8a5","name":"Fun and Free Community Dog Walk","weblink":"http://orangecounty.craigslist.org//pet/4598182088.html","price":"","category":"Pet","email":"5gvzs-4598182088@comm.craigslist.org","detail":"\n        Does your dog need to socialize more?

It features the advanced decoding circuitry (Dolby Digital, Pro Logic II, EX, DTS Digital Surround, Matrix 6, Neo:6) required to provide high-quality audio with extreme accuracy. It also uses integrated amplifiers to deliver approximately 110W to each channel, and Yamaha's proprietary Tri-Field Processing engine to ensure every Decibel is optimized for a true movie-theater experience. In fact, many reviewers have pointed out that the RX-V2300 produces high-quality audio right out the box-without any adjusted settings. However, the on-screen display (described as a bit complicated) offers several key functionalities for even better audio, including all-channel stereo DSP for a 6-speaker system, virtual cinema dsp for a two-stereo setup, and silent cinema specifically for 2-channel headphones. Additional features include an onboard tuner, an RS-232 interface for connecting to multi-room controllers, and downscaling-conversion (s-video to composite) for switching between sources without having to adjust inputs on the TV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T18:05:05.798Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/01212_2rQDS2Q04FP_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00u0u_PuuBtSYxtP_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01717_70AUKDPn1yk_600x450.jpg"]},{"_id":"53e26e51c1361800008300a5","name":"HDTV's - Let The \"New Year\" Begin With A \"Big Screen\" TV!!

This apartment is very new; I am the first person to live here since it was built, about 1 year. \n\nIt's a great apartment with very private views --- the balcony faces the backside parking lot and bedroom windows face the awesome trail behind Umbria apartments. So this means you don't see into other people's apartments, and no apartments can see into yours.\n\nGreat neighbors (very, very quiet) and just an amazing place to live. If I wasn't moving into a home I would stay here.\n\nThrough the leasing office the apartment is currently listed at $1795 which is A HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE than my current lease, $1695. This is a great deal; you save $100 a month for a great apartment, and there is about 10 months left on the lease.\n\n\nRESIDENCE FEATURES\nPrivate garage w/ remote, some with direct access*\nHardwood-style flooring throughout entry, kitchen, living & dining room\nFully-equipped kitchens with refrigerator with ice-maker, microwave, oven & dishwasher\nQuartz Stone countertops in kitchen and bath\nKitchen w/ white shaker panel cabinetry w/ rod pulls & recessed lighting\nIn home washer/dryer\n2\" Mini blinds\nWalk-In closets* or mirrored closet doors\nHigh-efficiency central heating /air conditioning\nIn-home Alarm System w/optional monitoring\nDigital/Cable TV Ready\nWired for High Speed Internet/multiple phone lines\nSmoke-free residences*\nPet friendly with dogs up to 21 inches welcome*\n\nCOMMUNITY AMENITIES\nResort-style saltwater pool, spa, poolside cabanas\nOutdoor fireplace & several BBQ areas\nWi-Fi Access in common areas*\nInternet Café with access to a MacBook, open lounging, and a multi-function printer\nSpacious clubroom with gourmet kitchen, pool table, shuffle board, plasma TV and outdoor terrace w/ dining tables\nCardio Theater fitness center with free weights and strength equipment with 24 hour access\nAccess to future community park will include ball fields, tennis/basketball courts & tot lot\nCentrally located to Irvine biking trails\n* In select floor plans/residences\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T17:46:27.078Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_3qsIZ5md5Ja_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01414_ceKKS2ToKIg_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_k8JTgqFgZpM_600x450.jpg"],"$$hashKey":"00P"},{"_id":"53e269f3df4a4a000043660e","name":"Taking Reservations for Spring 2015 Semester","weblink":"http://orangecounty.craigslist.org//apa/4606020781.html","price":"$1300","category":"Apartment","detail":"\n        University Crossings Apartments, managed by AMC\n2404 Nutwood Avenue\nFullerton, CA 92831\n show contact info\n\n\n\nOur residents have full access and are encouraged to take advantage of our Tropical Style Pool with Fire Pit and Music, State of the art Fitness Center, Business Lounge, and Free Wi-Fi in our clubhouse. \n\nBrand new cabinets, kitchen appliance package, fully renovated and more. \n\nApartment Features\n* Air Conditioning\n* Linen Closet\n* Vertical Blinds\n* Refrigerator, Microwave, Dishwasher & Gas Stove\n* Roommate Friendly Floor Plan\n* Pre-wired for internet and cable\n* Ceiling Fan\n\n[#1116622]\n\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T17:46:27.078Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_3wEdf5dsygT_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00v0v_2fEsMLard2_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00202_ka4vLcbq9Xi_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00s0s_kcEgoeqTTLt_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00000_jMngluPUf2t_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00T0T_lRvDiYulIu_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00D0D_h63QecUCRzR_600x450.jpg"],"$$hashKey":"00Q"},{"_id":"53e269f3df4a4a000043660b","name":"Great Studio Available in Sunny Mission Viejo!

Blackberry is super sweet and playful, however she can be a bit shy at first until she gets to know you and a level of trust is established. Based on her body type, she looks like a Belgian hare.

We make every effort to ensure the rabbits are rescued from these local county and city shelters so they won't be destroyed.\nWe care for and foster abandoned, neglected, abused, ill and injured domestic rabbits in a loving, stable, clean environment and provide quality nutrition and the necessary veterinary exams and medical care before a good home can be found.\n\nThe Sweetpea Foundation carefully screens potential adopters to ensure the living environment is suitable and that the rabbit(s) will be adopted into a loving, permanent home. We accomplish this via our web site, through referrals and by holding adoption events at pet stores such as PETCO and PetSmart.  Additionally, we post profiles of the adoptable rabbits on web sites such as Petfinder.com and BunSpace.com. The Sweetpea Foundation makes every effort to educate adopting and fostering families about the care of rabbits.

","weblink":"http://orangecounty.craigslist.org//pet/4605252852.html","price":"","category":"Pet","email":"9gmw4-4605252852@comm.craigslist.org","detail":"\n        I am sad to say, my little lady (Prissy) needs a new home. I have had her since I was 18 and she was a puppy (I am now 26) and she was the best little companion ever. I had just moved out and needed a friend. I found her living in a room with 3 other toy breeds destroying a roommates room. I \"requested\" she was given to me. She was my best friend. Prissy went everywhere with me. I even had her trained to hop in a litter box and use the bathroom on a puppy pad while I was at work.\n\nA few years later, I was moving out of California and was having difficulty bringing her. This happened to be around the time my families chihuahua had been put down due to old age. So I gave her to my little brother who was very sad about loosing his dog. This way I would still be able to see her and know she is being taken care of. \n\nShe stayed with my family for about 5 years. They fell in love with her (especially my little brother). She was spoiled and given soft food and table scraps (causing her to get major build up and a rotten mouth). She had also gained a few pounds (which for her tiny size is very noticeable).\n\nIn the middle of those 5 years, my parents ended up getting a divorce and poor little Prissy went from having a house with her own backyard, to a small 2 bedroom apartment. She didn't understand what was going on. She went from having a back yard to run in and out of all day to use the bathroom, to being confined to a small apartment, waiting for someone to come home from work or school to take her out. Naturally, this didn't work out too well. \n\nPrissy ended up using the bathroom all over the apartment and becoming hyper sensitive to every noise she heard outside, causing her to bark. I got a call saying they couldn't deal with her any more. So of course I came and got her. \n\nI got her eating right and back to a healthy weight, as well as using puppy pads while I was at work. She seemed to be getting back on track (despite her new barking habit). I was happy to have her back. She is the sweetest little thing. Loves to just cuddle up in your lap or press her body against your face requesting kisses. I quickly noticed how bad her breath was. \n\nWhen I took her to the vet, they told me that pretty much all her teeth are rotten. She would need to be put under anesthesia and have her teeth cleaned and most of her teeth would fall out during the process. The vet said it was due to years of her eating soft food and table scraps at my families house. I felt horrible for her. They told me it would be around $400 for the whole procedure. I did not have the money. Couple weeks later, she ended up rupturing an anal gland. I ended up having to spend $250 for medication and diapers to keep it sanitary. \n\nI don't know what is going on with her, but she has again stopped using puppy pads. I take her out and she uses the bathroom numerous times, but still comes inside and finds a corner to pee in. I don't get it. Maybe she is just getting old? Or since she is back to living in a house, she forgets where the puppy pads are? I don't know. When we lived in an apartment, she had no problem using the puppy pads. She also barks whenever she hears another dog outside or a person talking. My neighbors are beginning to complain. \n\nI love this lil lady so much, but I have come to the conclusion that it might be best for her to find a new home. Preferably a single older person with no kids and has time to be home with her the majority of the day so she has someone to cuddle and take her out. She was kept in solitary confinement for so many years with my family, that she now is very easily excited when being walked and wants to run after any and everything. She is a very spry little old lady. Does not act at all like a middle aged dog. She is constantly wanting to run and play when she is not cuddled up with you on the couch. You would think she was still a puppy the way she runs and plays. \n\n\n\n\n\nShe just needs someone who is calm and lives a quiet life somewhere with little to no noise. She would be perfect for and elderly woman in need of a companion. She is full of love and deserves a nice quiet life with someone who can take care of her teeth and give her tons of love and affection. She is about 8 years old (and I'm sure will live to be at least 16), and about 3lbs. Your hand is about the size of her whole body. She is a healthy little playful girl with a sassy attitude. At first, she doesn't seem to like company, but after they have sat down she is fine. She seems to feel intimidated when people are standing. She isn't aggressive, just talkative. Prissy is fixed as well. \n\nHer breed is pretty rare. Everyone thinks she is a chihuahua/min pin. But through research, I found out she is a Russian toy terrier. \n\nI am asking a small rehoming fee (100) so I feel confident in knowing you would be able to take care of her and her needs as she gets older. As of now, all she needs is her teethe removed. Other than that, she has the body and mind of a puppy. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read Prissy's story. If you would like to know anything else, or want more pics, feel free to send me an email. \n\nI am going to be picky about who takes her. So please be sure to read her story before messaging me. \n\n\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T17:41:32.987Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/00808_w3xsZDdpDW_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01717_fIoz9nbSNL_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_kN2cOH2oOzw_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_fl6FAHrNQoQ_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_grTlUsMakT3_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00f0f_bD4bsb9dbA6_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00G0G_7qk5fRjS9cs_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00d0d_6JQx0UABpYz_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00E0E_iBAaWkBsVbB_600x450.jpg"],"$$hashKey":"0QW"},{"_id":"53e268cc95d55f0000c2c8a7","name":"I have two dogs n love bird n parakeets","weblink":"http://orangecounty.craigslist.org//pet/4605303574.html","price":"","category":"Pet","email":"wjcw8-4605303574@comm.craigslist.org","detail":"\n        I have an albino white red nose pit and a bully black and white both have all there shots both good around kids I have had them since puppy's around my daughters I have an apt now so I can't keep them I want them to go to a good loving home both together they can have puppies still I haven't had none yet tho small rehoming fee of 125 to make sure they go to good home not fighting dogs please \n\nAlso have a blue love bird with cage I want 50 for it \nAlso have 3 parakeets with cage I want 50 for them \nThanks please text me at\n show contact info\nalbert\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T17:41:32.987Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/00y0y_hM8gwPjI89A_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01616_hStHMWuYEhT_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00x0x_kYPXEdK7twC_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00303_3eEZGp3aZgg_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00606_732UPbBsPGJ_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00d0d_1W8UhBd7LQi_600x450.jpg"],"$$hashKey":"0QX"},{"_id":"53e268cc95d55f0000c2c8a5","name":"Fun and Free Community Dog Walk","weblink":"http://orangecounty.craigslist.org//pet/4598182088.html","price":"","category":"Pet","email":"5gvzs-4598182088@comm.craigslist.org","detail":"\n        Does your dog need to socialize more?

It features the advanced decoding circuitry (Dolby Digital, Pro Logic II, EX, DTS Digital Surround, Matrix 6, Neo:6) required to provide high-quality audio with extreme accuracy. It also uses integrated amplifiers to deliver approximately 110W to each channel, and Yamaha's proprietary Tri-Field Processing engine to ensure every Decibel is optimized for a true movie-theater experience. In fact, many reviewers have pointed out that the RX-V2300 produces high-quality audio right out the box-without any adjusted settings. However, the on-screen display (described as a bit complicated) offers several key functionalities for even better audio, including all-channel stereo DSP for a 6-speaker system, virtual cinema dsp for a two-stereo setup, and silent cinema specifically for 2-channel headphones. Additional features include an onboard tuner, an RS-232 interface for connecting to multi-room controllers, and downscaling-conversion (s-video to composite) for switching between sources without having to adjust inputs on the TV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T18:05:05.798Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/01212_2rQDS2Q04FP_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00u0u_PuuBtSYxtP_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01717_70AUKDPn1yk_600x450.jpg"],"$$hashKey":"09I"},{"_id":"53e26e51c1361800008300a5","name":"HDTV's - Let The \"New Year\" Begin With A \"Big Screen\" TV!!

This apartment is very new; I am the first person to live here since it was built, about 1 year. \n\nIt's a great apartment with very private views --- the balcony faces the backside parking lot and bedroom windows face the awesome trail behind Umbria apartments. So this means you don't see into other people's apartments, and no apartments can see into yours.\n\nGreat neighbors (very, very quiet) and just an amazing place to live. If I wasn't moving into a home I would stay here.\n\nThrough the leasing office the apartment is currently listed at $1795 which is A HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE than my current lease, $1695. This is a great deal; you save $100 a month for a great apartment, and there is about 10 months left on the lease.\n\n\nRESIDENCE FEATURES\nPrivate garage w/ remote, some with direct access*\nHardwood-style flooring throughout entry, kitchen, living & dining room\nFully-equipped kitchens with refrigerator with ice-maker, microwave, oven & dishwasher\nQuartz Stone countertops in kitchen and bath\nKitchen w/ white shaker panel cabinetry w/ rod pulls & recessed lighting\nIn home washer/dryer\n2\" Mini blinds\nWalk-In closets* or mirrored closet doors\nHigh-efficiency central heating /air conditioning\nIn-home Alarm System w/optional monitoring\nDigital/Cable TV Ready\nWired for High Speed Internet/multiple phone lines\nSmoke-free residences*\nPet friendly with dogs up to 21 inches welcome*\n\nCOMMUNITY AMENITIES\nResort-style saltwater pool, spa, poolside cabanas\nOutdoor fireplace & several BBQ areas\nWi-Fi Access in common areas*\nInternet Café with access to a MacBook, open lounging, and a multi-function printer\nSpacious clubroom with gourmet kitchen, pool table, shuffle board, plasma TV and outdoor terrace w/ dining tables\nCardio Theater fitness center with free weights and strength equipment with 24 hour access\nAccess to future community park will include ball fields, tennis/basketball courts & tot lot\nCentrally located to Irvine biking trails\n* In select floor plans/residences\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T17:46:27.078Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_3qsIZ5md5Ja_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01414_ceKKS2ToKIg_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_k8JTgqFgZpM_600x450.jpg"]},{"_id":"53e269f3df4a4a000043660e","name":"Taking Reservations for Spring 2015 Semester","weblink":"http://orangecounty.craigslist.org//apa/4606020781.html","price":"$1300","category":"Apartment","detail":"\n        University Crossings Apartments, managed by AMC\n2404 Nutwood Avenue\nFullerton, CA 92831\n show contact info\n\n\n\nOur residents have full access and are encouraged to take advantage of our Tropical Style Pool with Fire Pit and Music, State of the art Fitness Center, Business Lounge, and Free Wi-Fi in our clubhouse. \n\nBrand new cabinets, kitchen appliance package, fully renovated and more. \n\nApartment Features\n* Air Conditioning\n* Linen Closet\n* Vertical Blinds\n* Refrigerator, Microwave, Dishwasher & Gas Stove\n* Roommate Friendly Floor Plan\n* Pre-wired for internet and cable\n* Ceiling Fan\n\n[#1116622]\n\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T17:46:27.078Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_3wEdf5dsygT_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00v0v_2fEsMLard2_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00202_ka4vLcbq9Xi_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00s0s_kcEgoeqTTLt_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00000_jMngluPUf2t_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00T0T_lRvDiYulIu_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00D0D_h63QecUCRzR_600x450.jpg"]},{"_id":"53e269f3df4a4a000043660b","name":"Great Studio Available in Sunny Mission Viejo!

Blackberry is super sweet and playful, however she can be a bit shy at first until she gets to know you and a level of trust is established. Based on her body type, she looks like a Belgian hare.

We make every effort to ensure the rabbits are rescued from these local county and city shelters so they won't be destroyed.\nWe care for and foster abandoned, neglected, abused, ill and injured domestic rabbits in a loving, stable, clean environment and provide quality nutrition and the necessary veterinary exams and medical care before a good home can be found.\n\nThe Sweetpea Foundation carefully screens potential adopters to ensure the living environment is suitable and that the rabbit(s) will be adopted into a loving, permanent home. We accomplish this via our web site, through referrals and by holding adoption events at pet stores such as PETCO and PetSmart.  Additionally, we post profiles of the adoptable rabbits on web sites such as Petfinder.com and BunSpace.com. The Sweetpea Foundation makes every effort to educate adopting and fostering families about the care of rabbits.

","weblink":"http://orangecounty.craigslist.org//pet/4605252852.html","price":"","category":"Pet","email":"9gmw4-4605252852@comm.craigslist.org","detail":"\n        I am sad to say, my little lady (Prissy) needs a new home. I have had her since I was 18 and she was a puppy (I am now 26) and she was the best little companion ever. I had just moved out and needed a friend. I found her living in a room with 3 other toy breeds destroying a roommates room. I \"requested\" she was given to me. She was my best friend. Prissy went everywhere with me. I even had her trained to hop in a litter box and use the bathroom on a puppy pad while I was at work.\n\nA few years later, I was moving out of California and was having difficulty bringing her. This happened to be around the time my families chihuahua had been put down due to old age. So I gave her to my little brother who was very sad about loosing his dog. This way I would still be able to see her and know she is being taken care of. \n\nShe stayed with my family for about 5 years. They fell in love with her (especially my little brother). She was spoiled and given soft food and table scraps (causing her to get major build up and a rotten mouth). She had also gained a few pounds (which for her tiny size is very noticeable).\n\nIn the middle of those 5 years, my parents ended up getting a divorce and poor little Prissy went from having a house with her own backyard, to a small 2 bedroom apartment. She didn't understand what was going on. She went from having a back yard to run in and out of all day to use the bathroom, to being confined to a small apartment, waiting for someone to come home from work or school to take her out. Naturally, this didn't work out too well. \n\nPrissy ended up using the bathroom all over the apartment and becoming hyper sensitive to every noise she heard outside, causing her to bark. I got a call saying they couldn't deal with her any more. So of course I came and got her. \n\nI got her eating right and back to a healthy weight, as well as using puppy pads while I was at work. She seemed to be getting back on track (despite her new barking habit). I was happy to have her back. She is the sweetest little thing. Loves to just cuddle up in your lap or press her body against your face requesting kisses. I quickly noticed how bad her breath was. \n\nWhen I took her to the vet, they told me that pretty much all her teeth are rotten. She would need to be put under anesthesia and have her teeth cleaned and most of her teeth would fall out during the process. The vet said it was due to years of her eating soft food and table scraps at my families house. I felt horrible for her. They told me it would be around $400 for the whole procedure. I did not have the money. Couple weeks later, she ended up rupturing an anal gland. I ended up having to spend $250 for medication and diapers to keep it sanitary. \n\nI don't know what is going on with her, but she has again stopped using puppy pads. I take her out and she uses the bathroom numerous times, but still comes inside and finds a corner to pee in. I don't get it. Maybe she is just getting old? Or since she is back to living in a house, she forgets where the puppy pads are? I don't know. When we lived in an apartment, she had no problem using the puppy pads. She also barks whenever she hears another dog outside or a person talking. My neighbors are beginning to complain. \n\nI love this lil lady so much, but I have come to the conclusion that it might be best for her to find a new home. Preferably a single older person with no kids and has time to be home with her the majority of the day so she has someone to cuddle and take her out. She was kept in solitary confinement for so many years with my family, that she now is very easily excited when being walked and wants to run after any and everything. She is a very spry little old lady. Does not act at all like a middle aged dog. She is constantly wanting to run and play when she is not cuddled up with you on the couch. You would think she was still a puppy the way she runs and plays. \n\n\n\n\n\nShe just needs someone who is calm and lives a quiet life somewhere with little to no noise. She would be perfect for and elderly woman in need of a companion. She is full of love and deserves a nice quiet life with someone who can take care of her teeth and give her tons of love and affection. She is about 8 years old (and I'm sure will live to be at least 16), and about 3lbs. Your hand is about the size of her whole body. She is a healthy little playful girl with a sassy attitude. At first, she doesn't seem to like company, but after they have sat down she is fine. She seems to feel intimidated when people are standing. She isn't aggressive, just talkative. Prissy is fixed as well. \n\nHer breed is pretty rare. Everyone thinks she is a chihuahua/min pin. But through research, I found out she is a Russian toy terrier. \n\nI am asking a small rehoming fee (100) so I feel confident in knowing you would be able to take care of her and her needs as she gets older. As of now, all she needs is her teethe removed. Other than that, she has the body and mind of a puppy. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read Prissy's story.

It features the advanced decoding circuitry (Dolby Digital, Pro Logic II, EX, DTS Digital Surround, Matrix 6, Neo:6) required to provide high-quality audio with extreme accuracy. It also uses integrated amplifiers to deliver approximately 110W to each channel, and Yamaha's proprietary Tri-Field Processing engine to ensure every Decibel is optimized for a true movie-theater experience. In fact, many reviewers have pointed out that the RX-V2300 produces high-quality audio right out the box-without any adjusted settings. However, the on-screen display (described as a bit complicated) offers several key functionalities for even better audio, including all-channel stereo DSP for a 6-speaker system, virtual cinema dsp for a two-stereo setup, and silent cinema specifically for 2-channel headphones. Additional features include an onboard tuner, an RS-232 interface for connecting to multi-room controllers, and downscaling-conversion (s-video to composite) for switching between sources without having to adjust inputs on the TV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T18:05:05.798Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/01212_2rQDS2Q04FP_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00u0u_PuuBtSYxtP_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01717_70AUKDPn1yk_600x450.jpg"]},{"_id":"53e26e51c1361800008300a5","name":"HDTV's - Let The \"New Year\" Begin With A \"Big Screen\" TV!!

If I wasn't moving into a home I would stay here.\n\nThrough the leasing office the apartment is currently listed at $1795 which is A HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE than my current lease, $1695.

Blackberry is super sweet and playful, however she can be a bit shy at first until she gets to know you and a level of trust is established. Based on her body type, she looks like a Belgian hare.

We make every effort to ensure the rabbits are rescued from these local county and city shelters so they won't be destroyed.\nWe care for and foster abandoned, neglected, abused, ill and injured domestic rabbits in a loving, stable, clean environment and provide quality nutrition and the necessary veterinary exams and medical care before a good home can be found.\n\nThe Sweetpea Foundation carefully screens potential adopters to ensure the living environment is suitable and that the rabbit(s) will be adopted into a loving, permanent home. We accomplish this via our web site, through referrals and by holding adoption events at pet stores such as PETCO and PetSmart.  Additionally, we post profiles of the adoptable rabbits on web sites such as Petfinder.com and BunSpace.com. The Sweetpea Foundation makes every effort to educate adopting and fostering families about the care of rabbits.

","weblink":"http://orangecounty.craigslist.org//pet/4605252852.html","price":"","category":"Pet","email":"9gmw4-4605252852@comm.craigslist.org","detail":"\n        I am sad to say, my little lady (Prissy) needs a new home. I have had her since I was 18 and she was a puppy (I am now 26) and she was the best little companion ever. I had just moved out and needed a friend. I found her living in a room with 3 other toy breeds destroying a roommates room. I \"requested\" she was given to me. She was my best friend. Prissy went everywhere with me. I even had her trained to hop in a litter box and use the bathroom on a puppy pad while I was at work.\n\nA few years later, I was moving out of California and was having difficulty bringing her. This happened to be around the time my families chihuahua had been put down due to old age. So I gave her to my little brother who was very sad about loosing his dog. This way I would still be able to see her and know she is being taken care of. \n\nShe stayed with my family for about 5 years. They fell in love with her (especially my little brother). She was spoiled and given soft food and table scraps (causing her to get major build up and a rotten mouth). She had also gained a few pounds (which for her tiny size is very noticeable).\n\nIn the middle of those 5 years, my parents ended up getting a divorce and poor little Prissy went from having a house with her own backyard, to a small 2 bedroom apartment. She didn't understand what was going on. She went from having a back yard to run in and out of all day to use the bathroom, to being confined to a small apartment, waiting for someone to come home from work or school to take her out. Naturally, this didn't work out too well. \n\nPrissy ended up using the bathroom all over the apartment and becoming hyper sensitive to every noise she heard outside, causing her to bark. I got a call saying they couldn't deal with her any more. So of course I came and got her. \n\nI got her eating right and back to a healthy weight, as well as using puppy pads while I was at work. She seemed to be getting back on track (despite her new barking habit). I was happy to have her back. She is the sweetest little thing. Loves to just cuddle up in your lap or press her body against your face requesting kisses. I quickly noticed how bad her breath was. \n\nWhen I took her to the vet, they told me that pretty much all her teeth are rotten. She would need to be put under anesthesia and have her teeth cleaned and most of her teeth would fall out during the process. The vet said it was due to years of her eating soft food and table scraps at my families house. I felt horrible for her. They told me it would be around $400 for the whole procedure. I did not have the money. Couple weeks later, she ended up rupturing an anal gland. I ended up having to spend $250 for medication and diapers to keep it sanitary. \n\nI don't know what is going on with her, but she has again stopped using puppy pads. I take her out and she uses the bathroom numerous times, but still comes inside and finds a corner to pee in. I don't get it. Maybe she is just getting old? Or since she is back to living in a house, she forgets where the puppy pads are? I don't know. When we lived in an apartment, she had no problem using the puppy pads. She also barks whenever she hears another dog outside or a person talking. My neighbors are beginning to complain. \n\nI love this lil lady so much, but I have come to the conclusion that it might be best for her to find a new home. Preferably a single older person with no kids and has time to be home with her the majority of the day so she has someone to cuddle and take her out. She was kept in solitary confinement for so many years with my family, that she now is very easily excited when being walked and wants to run after any and everything. She is a very spry little old lady. Does not act at all like a middle aged dog. She is constantly wanting to run and play when she is not cuddled up with you on the couch. You would think she was still a puppy the way she runs and plays. \n\n\n\n\n\nShe just needs someone who is calm and lives a quiet life somewhere with little to no noise. She would be perfect for and elderly woman in need of a companion. She is full of love and deserves a nice quiet life with someone who can take care of her teeth and give her tons of love and affection. She is about 8 years old (and I'm sure will live to be at least 16), and about 3lbs. Your hand is about the size of her whole body. She is a healthy little playful girl with a sassy attitude. At first, she doesn't seem to like company, but after they have sat down she is fine. She seems to feel intimidated when people are standing. She isn't aggressive, just talkative. Prissy is fixed as well. \n\nHer breed is pretty rare. Everyone thinks she is a chihuahua/min pin. But through research, I found out she is a Russian toy terrier. \n\nI am asking a small rehoming fee (100) so I feel confident in knowing you would be able to take care of her and her needs as she gets older. As of now, all she needs is her teethe removed. Other than that, she has the body and mind of a puppy. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read Prissy's story.

It features the advanced decoding circuitry (Dolby Digital, Pro Logic II, EX, DTS Digital Surround, Matrix 6, Neo:6) required to provide high-quality audio with extreme accuracy. It also uses integrated amplifiers to deliver approximately 110W to each channel, and Yamaha's proprietary Tri-Field Processing engine to ensure every Decibel is optimized for a true movie-theater experience. In fact, many reviewers have pointed out that the RX-V2300 produces high-quality audio right out the box-without any adjusted settings. However, the on-screen display (described as a bit complicated) offers several key functionalities for even better audio, including all-channel stereo DSP for a 6-speaker system, virtual cinema dsp for a two-stereo setup, and silent cinema specifically for 2-channel headphones. Additional features include an onboard tuner, an RS-232 interface for connecting to multi-room controllers, and downscaling-conversion (s-video to composite) for switching between sources without having to adjust inputs on the TV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T18:05:05.798Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/01212_2rQDS2Q04FP_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00u0u_PuuBtSYxtP_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01717_70AUKDPn1yk_600x450.jpg"]},{"_id":"53e26e51c1361800008300a5","name":"HDTV's - Let The \"New Year\" Begin With A \"Big Screen\" TV!!

Blackberry is super sweet and playful, however she can be a bit shy at first until she gets to know you and a level of trust is established. Based on her body type, she looks like a Belgian hare.

We make every effort to ensure the rabbits are rescued from these local county and city shelters so they won't be destroyed.\nWe care for and foster abandoned, neglected, abused, ill and injured domestic rabbits in a loving, stable, clean environment and provide quality nutrition and the necessary veterinary exams and medical care before a good home can be found.\n\nThe Sweetpea Foundation carefully screens potential adopters to ensure the living environment is suitable and that the rabbit(s) will be adopted into a loving, permanent home. We accomplish this via our web site, through referrals and by holding adoption events at pet stores such as PETCO and PetSmart.  Additionally, we post profiles of the adoptable rabbits on web sites such as Petfinder.com and BunSpace.com. The Sweetpea Foundation makes every effort to educate adopting and fostering families about the care of rabbits.

","weblink":"http://orangecounty.craigslist.org//pet/4605252852.html","price":"","category":"Pet","email":"9gmw4-4605252852@comm.craigslist.org","detail":"\n        I am sad to say, my little lady (Prissy) needs a new home. I have had her since I was 18 and she was a puppy (I am now 26) and she was the best little companion ever. I had just moved out and needed a friend. I found her living in a room with 3 other toy breeds destroying a roommates room. I \"requested\" she was given to me. She was my best friend. Prissy went everywhere with me. I even had her trained to hop in a litter box and use the bathroom on a puppy pad while I was at work.\n\nA few years later, I was moving out of California and was having difficulty bringing her. This happened to be around the time my families chihuahua had been put down due to old age. So I gave her to my little brother who was very sad about loosing his dog. This way I would still be able to see her and know she is being taken care of. \n\nShe stayed with my family for about 5 years. They fell in love with her (especially my little brother). She was spoiled and given soft food and table scraps (causing her to get major build up and a rotten mouth). She had also gained a few pounds (which for her tiny size is very noticeable).\n\nIn the middle of those 5 years, my parents ended up getting a divorce and poor little Prissy went from having a house with her own backyard, to a small 2 bedroom apartment. She didn't understand what was going on. She went from having a back yard to run in and out of all day to use the bathroom, to being confined to a small apartment, waiting for someone to come home from work or school to take her out. Naturally, this didn't work out too well. \n\nPrissy ended up using the bathroom all over the apartment and becoming hyper sensitive to every noise she heard outside, causing her to bark. I got a call saying they couldn't deal with her any more. So of course I came and got her. \n\nI got her eating right and back to a healthy weight, as well as using puppy pads while I was at work. She seemed to be getting back on track (despite her new barking habit). I was happy to have her back. She is the sweetest little thing. Loves to just cuddle up in your lap or press her body against your face requesting kisses. I quickly noticed how bad her breath was. \n\nWhen I took her to the vet, they told me that pretty much all her teeth are rotten. She would need to be put under anesthesia and have her teeth cleaned and most of her teeth would fall out during the process. The vet said it was due to years of her eating soft food and table scraps at my families house. I felt horrible for her. They told me it would be around $400 for the whole procedure. I did not have the money. Couple weeks later, she ended up rupturing an anal gland. I ended up having to spend $250 for medication and diapers to keep it sanitary. \n\nI don't know what is going on with her, but she has again stopped using puppy pads. I take her out and she uses the bathroom numerous times, but still comes inside and finds a corner to pee in. I don't get it. Maybe she is just getting old? Or since she is back to living in a house, she forgets where the puppy pads are? I don't know. When we lived in an apartment, she had no problem using the puppy pads. She also barks whenever she hears another dog outside or a person talking. My neighbors are beginning to complain. \n\nI love this lil lady so much, but I have come to the conclusion that it might be best for her to find a new home. Preferably a single older person with no kids and has time to be home with her the majority of the day so she has someone to cuddle and take her out. She was kept in solitary confinement for so many years with my family, that she now is very easily excited when being walked and wants to run after any and everything. She is a very spry little old lady. Does not act at all like a middle aged dog. She is constantly wanting to run and play when she is not cuddled up with you on the couch. You would think she was still a puppy the way she runs and plays. \n\n\n\n\n\nShe just needs someone who is calm and lives a quiet life somewhere with little to no noise. She would be perfect for and elderly woman in need of a companion. She is full of love and deserves a nice quiet life with someone who can take care of her teeth and give her tons of love and affection. She is about 8 years old (and I'm sure will live to be at least 16), and about 3lbs. Your hand is about the size of her whole body. She is a healthy little playful girl with a sassy attitude. At first, she doesn't seem to like company, but after they have sat down she is fine. She seems to feel intimidated when people are standing. She isn't aggressive, just talkative. Prissy is fixed as well. \n\nHer breed is pretty rare. Everyone thinks she is a chihuahua/min pin. But through research, I found out she is a Russian toy terrier. \n\nI am asking a small rehoming fee (100) so I feel confident in knowing you would be able to take care of her and her needs as she gets older. As of now, all she needs is her teethe removed. Other than that, she has the body and mind of a puppy. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read Prissy's story.

It features the advanced decoding circuitry (Dolby Digital, Pro Logic II, EX, DTS Digital Surround, Matrix 6, Neo:6) required to provide high-quality audio with extreme accuracy. It also uses integrated amplifiers to deliver approximately 110W to each channel, and Yamaha's proprietary Tri-Field Processing engine to ensure every Decibel is optimized for a true movie-theater experience. In fact, many reviewers have pointed out that the RX-V2300 produces high-quality audio right out the box-without any adjusted settings. However, the on-screen display (described as a bit complicated) offers several key functionalities for even better audio, including all-channel stereo DSP for a 6-speaker system, virtual cinema dsp for a two-stereo setup, and silent cinema specifically for 2-channel headphones. Additional features include an onboard tuner, an RS-232 interface for connecting to multi-room controllers, and downscaling-conversion (s-video to composite) for switching between sources without having to adjust inputs on the TV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T18:05:05.798Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/01212_2rQDS2Q04FP_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00u0u_PuuBtSYxtP_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01717_70AUKDPn1yk_600x450.jpg"]},{"_id":"53e26e51c1361800008300a5","name":"HDTV's - Let The \"New Year\" Begin With A \"Big Screen\" TV!!

This apartment is very new; I am the first person to live here since it was built, about 1 year. \n\nIt's a great apartment with very private views --- the balcony faces the backside parking lot and bedroom windows face the awesome trail behind Umbria apartments. So this means you don't see into other people's apartments, and no apartments can see into yours.\n\nGreat neighbors (very, very quiet) and just an amazing place to live. If I wasn't moving into a home I would stay here.\n\nThrough the leasing office the apartment is currently listed at $1795 which is A HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE than my current lease, $1695.

We make every effort to ensure the rabbits are rescued from these local county and city shelters so they won't be destroyed.\nWe care for and foster abandoned, neglected, abused, ill and injured domestic rabbits in a loving, stable, clean environment and provide quality nutrition and the necessary veterinary exams and medical care before a good home can be found.\n\nThe Sweetpea Foundation carefully screens potential adopters to ensure the living environment is suitable and that the rabbit(s) will be adopted into a loving, permanent home. We accomplish this via our web site, through referrals and by holding adoption events at pet stores such as PETCO and PetSmart.  Additionally, we post profiles of the adoptable rabbits on web sites such as Petfinder.com and BunSpace.com. The Sweetpea Foundation makes every effort to educate adopting and fostering families about the care of rabbits. We also provide information on proper diet, housing, the importance of spaying, neutering and other necessary medical care.\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T17:41:32.994Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/00I0I_6N4W1unaK5k_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00t0t_7W4Jaw08pVR_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01313_2Tn0hLvIYtp_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01010_4xRO77HLrkT_600x450.jpg"]},{"_id":"53e268cc95d55f0000c2c8b6","name":"Horned Lizard","weblink":"http://orangecounty.craigslist.org//pet/4605101417.html","price":"","category":"Pet","email":"whfwd-4605101417@comm.craigslist.org","detail":"\n         Horned Toad Lizard are squirt blood from their eyes directly into a preys eyes. have limited availability for $75. they live in the dessert environment which makes them easy to care for.

","weblink":"http://orangecounty.craigslist.org//pet/4605252852.html","price":"","category":"Pet","email":"9gmw4-4605252852@comm.craigslist.org","detail":"\n        I am sad to say, my little lady (Prissy) needs a new home. I have had her since I was 18 and she was a puppy (I am now 26) and she was the best little companion ever. I had just moved out and needed a friend. I found her living in a room with 3 other toy breeds destroying a roommates room. I \"requested\" she was given to me. She was my best friend. Prissy went everywhere with me. I even had her trained to hop in a litter box and use the bathroom on a puppy pad while I was at work.\n\nA few years later, I was moving out of California and was having difficulty bringing her. This happened to be around the time my families chihuahua had been put down due to old age. So I gave her to my little brother who was very sad about loosing his dog. This way I would still be able to see her and know she is being taken care of. \n\nShe stayed with my family for about 5 years. They fell in love with her (especially my little brother). She was spoiled and given soft food and table scraps (causing her to get major build up and a rotten mouth). She had also gained a few pounds (which for her tiny size is very noticeable).\n\nIn the middle of those 5 years, my parents ended up getting a divorce and poor little Prissy went from having a house with her own backyard, to a small 2 bedroom apartment. She didn't understand what was going on. She went from having a back yard to run in and out of all day to use the bathroom, to being confined to a small apartment, waiting for someone to come home from work or school to take her out. Naturally, this didn't work out too well. \n\nPrissy ended up using the bathroom all over the apartment and becoming hyper sensitive to every noise she heard outside, causing her to bark. I got a call saying they couldn't deal with her any more. So of course I came and got her. \n\nI got her eating right and back to a healthy weight, as well as using puppy pads while I was at work. She seemed to be getting back on track (despite her new barking habit). I was happy to have her back. She is the sweetest little thing. Loves to just cuddle up in your lap or press her body against your face requesting kisses. I quickly noticed how bad her breath was. \n\nWhen I took her to the vet, they told me that pretty much all her teeth are rotten. She would need to be put under anesthesia and have her teeth cleaned and most of her teeth would fall out during the process. The vet said it was due to years of her eating soft food and table scraps at my families house. I felt horrible for her. They told me it would be around $400 for the whole procedure. I did not have the money. Couple weeks later, she ended up rupturing an anal gland. I ended up having to spend $250 for medication and diapers to keep it sanitary. \n\nI don't know what is going on with her, but she has again stopped using puppy pads. I take her out and she uses the bathroom numerous times, but still comes inside and finds a corner to pee in. I don't get it. Maybe she is just getting old? Or since she is back to living in a house, she forgets where the puppy pads are? I don't know. When we lived in an apartment, she had no problem using the puppy pads. She also barks whenever she hears another dog outside or a person talking. My neighbors are beginning to complain. \n\nI love this lil lady so much, but I have come to the conclusion that it might be best for her to find a new home. Preferably a single older person with no kids and has time to be home with her the majority of the day so she has someone to cuddle and take her out. She was kept in solitary confinement for so many years with my family, that she now is very easily excited when being walked and wants to run after any and everything. She is a very spry little old lady. Does not act at all like a middle aged dog. She is constantly wanting to run and play when she is not cuddled up with you on the couch. You would think she was still a puppy the way she runs and plays. \n\n\n\n\n\nShe just needs someone who is calm and lives a quiet life somewhere with little to no noise. She would be perfect for and elderly woman in need of a companion. She is full of love and deserves a nice quiet life with someone who can take care of her teeth and give her tons of love and affection. She is about 8 years old (and I'm sure will live to be at least 16), and about 3lbs. Your hand is about the size of her whole body. She is a healthy little playful girl with a sassy attitude. At first, she doesn't seem to like company, but after they have sat down she is fine. She seems to feel intimidated when people are standing. She isn't aggressive, just talkative. Prissy is fixed as well. \n\nHer breed is pretty rare. Everyone thinks she is a chihuahua/min pin. But through research, I found out she is a Russian toy terrier. \n\nI am asking a small rehoming fee (100) so I feel confident in knowing you would be able to take care of her and her needs as she gets older. As of now, all she needs is her teethe removed. Other than that, she has the body and mind of a puppy. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read Prissy's story. If you would like to know anything else, or want more pics, feel free to send me an email. \n\nI am going to be picky about who takes her. So please be sure to read her story before messaging me. \n\n\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T17:41:32.987Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/00808_w3xsZDdpDW_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01717_fIoz9nbSNL_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_kN2cOH2oOzw_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_fl6FAHrNQoQ_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_grTlUsMakT3_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00f0f_bD4bsb9dbA6_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00G0G_7qk5fRjS9cs_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00d0d_6JQx0UABpYz_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00E0E_iBAaWkBsVbB_600x450.jpg"]},{"_id":"53e2f2a7ed225a1602d5f05c","name":"test","weblink":"none","price":"$300","category":"Furniture","email":"rodch100@mail.chapman.edu","detail":"test","location":"orange","source":"yardsale","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-07T03:29:43.070Z","image":["http://topcars.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/businessmanager/no-image-available2.jpg"]},{"_id":"53e2716254de9f000061d21e","name":"MUST SEE!!

It features the advanced decoding circuitry (Dolby Digital, Pro Logic II, EX, DTS Digital Surround, Matrix 6, Neo:6) required to provide high-quality audio with extreme accuracy. It also uses integrated amplifiers to deliver approximately 110W to each channel, and Yamaha's proprietary Tri-Field Processing engine to ensure every Decibel is optimized for a true movie-theater experience. In fact, many reviewers have pointed out that the RX-V2300 produces high-quality audio right out the box-without any adjusted settings. However, the on-screen display (described as a bit complicated) offers several key functionalities for even better audio, including all-channel stereo DSP for a 6-speaker system, virtual cinema dsp for a two-stereo setup, and silent cinema specifically for 2-channel headphones. Additional features include an onboard tuner, an RS-232 interface for connecting to multi-room controllers, and downscaling-conversion (s-video to composite) for switching between sources without having to adjust inputs on the TV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T18:05:05.798Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/01212_2rQDS2Q04FP_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00u0u_PuuBtSYxtP_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01717_70AUKDPn1yk_600x450.jpg"]},{"_id":"53e26e51c1361800008300a5","name":"HDTV's - Let The \"New Year\" Begin With A \"Big Screen\" TV!!

Both are roughly 5.5 - 6 years old. Duncan is a very playful, happy little boy who is anxious to get as much attention as he possibly can. He's hard to resist, trust us on that. Blackberry is super sweet and playful, however she can be a bit shy at first until she gets to know you and a level of trust is established. Based on her body type, she looks like a Belgian hare. Watching them snuggle and play together is a joy, and their antics will have you laughing.

We make every effort to ensure the rabbits are rescued from these local county and city shelters so they won't be destroyed.\nWe care for and foster abandoned, neglected, abused, ill and injured domestic rabbits in a loving, stable, clean environment and provide quality nutrition and the necessary veterinary exams and medical care before a good home can be found.\n\nThe Sweetpea Foundation carefully screens potential adopters to ensure the living environment is suitable and that the rabbit(s) will be adopted into a loving, permanent home. We accomplish this via our web site, through referrals and by holding adoption events at pet stores such as PETCO and PetSmart.  Additionally, we post profiles of the adoptable rabbits on web sites such as Petfinder.com and BunSpace.com. The Sweetpea Foundation makes every effort to educate adopting and fostering families about the care of rabbits. We also provide information on proper diet, housing, the importance of spaying, neutering and other necessary medical care.\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T17:41:32.994Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/00I0I_6N4W1unaK5k_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00t0t_7W4Jaw08pVR_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01313_2Tn0hLvIYtp_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01010_4xRO77HLrkT_600x450.jpg"],"$$hashKey":"0DQ"},{"_id":"53e268cc95d55f0000c2c8b6","name":"Horned Lizard","weblink":"http://orangecounty.craigslist.org//pet/4605101417.html","price":"","category":"Pet","email":"whfwd-4605101417@comm.craigslist.org","detail":"\n         Horned Toad Lizard are squirt blood from their eyes directly into a preys eyes. have limited availability for $75. they live in the dessert environment which makes them easy to care for.

","weblink":"http://orangecounty.craigslist.org//pet/4605252852.html","price":"","category":"Pet","email":"9gmw4-4605252852@comm.craigslist.org","detail":"\n        I am sad to say, my little lady (Prissy) needs a new home. I have had her since I was 18 and she was a puppy (I am now 26) and she was the best little companion ever. I had just moved out and needed a friend. I found her living in a room with 3 other toy breeds destroying a roommates room. I \"requested\" she was given to me. She was my best friend. Prissy went everywhere with me. I even had her trained to hop in a litter box and use the bathroom on a puppy pad while I was at work.\n\nA few years later, I was moving out of California and was having difficulty bringing her. This happened to be around the time my families chihuahua had been put down due to old age. So I gave her to my little brother who was very sad about loosing his dog. This way I would still be able to see her and know she is being taken care of. \n\nShe stayed with my family for about 5 years. They fell in love with her (especially my little brother). She was spoiled and given soft food and table scraps (causing her to get major build up and a rotten mouth). She had also gained a few pounds (which for her tiny size is very noticeable).\n\nIn the middle of those 5 years, my parents ended up getting a divorce and poor little Prissy went from having a house with her own backyard, to a small 2 bedroom apartment. She didn't understand what was going on. She went from having a back yard to run in and out of all day to use the bathroom, to being confined to a small apartment, waiting for someone to come home from work or school to take her out. Naturally, this didn't work out too well. \n\nPrissy ended up using the bathroom all over the apartment and becoming hyper sensitive to every noise she heard outside, causing her to bark. I got a call saying they couldn't deal with her any more. So of course I came and got her. \n\nI got her eating right and back to a healthy weight, as well as using puppy pads while I was at work. She seemed to be getting back on track (despite her new barking habit). I was happy to have her back. She is the sweetest little thing. Loves to just cuddle up in your lap or press her body against your face requesting kisses. I quickly noticed how bad her breath was. \n\nWhen I took her to the vet, they told me that pretty much all her teeth are rotten. She would need to be put under anesthesia and have her teeth cleaned and most of her teeth would fall out during the process. The vet said it was due to years of her eating soft food and table scraps at my families house. I felt horrible for her. They told me it would be around $400 for the whole procedure. I did not have the money. Couple weeks later, she ended up rupturing an anal gland. I ended up having to spend $250 for medication and diapers to keep it sanitary. \n\nI don't know what is going on with her, but she has again stopped using puppy pads. I take her out and she uses the bathroom numerous times, but still comes inside and finds a corner to pee in. I don't get it. Maybe she is just getting old? Or since she is back to living in a house, she forgets where the puppy pads are? I don't know. When we lived in an apartment, she had no problem using the puppy pads. She also barks whenever she hears another dog outside or a person talking. My neighbors are beginning to complain. \n\nI love this lil lady so much, but I have come to the conclusion that it might be best for her to find a new home. Preferably a single older person with no kids and has time to be home with her the majority of the day so she has someone to cuddle and take her out. She was kept in solitary confinement for so many years with my family, that she now is very easily excited when being walked and wants to run after any and everything. She is a very spry little old lady. Does not act at all like a middle aged dog. She is constantly wanting to run and play when she is not cuddled up with you on the couch. You would think she was still a puppy the way she runs and plays. \n\n\n\n\n\nShe just needs someone who is calm and lives a quiet life somewhere with little to no noise. She would be perfect for and elderly woman in need of a companion. She is full of love and deserves a nice quiet life with someone who can take care of her teeth and give her tons of love and affection. She is about 8 years old (and I'm sure will live to be at least 16), and about 3lbs. Your hand is about the size of her whole body. She is a healthy little playful girl with a sassy attitude. At first, she doesn't seem to like company, but after they have sat down she is fine. She seems to feel intimidated when people are standing. She isn't aggressive, just talkative. Prissy is fixed as well. \n\nHer breed is pretty rare. Everyone thinks she is a chihuahua/min pin. But through research, I found out she is a Russian toy terrier. \n\nI am asking a small rehoming fee (100) so I feel confident in knowing you would be able to take care of her and her needs as she gets older. As of now, all she needs is her teethe removed. Other than that, she has the body and mind of a puppy. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read Prissy's story. If you would like to know anything else, or want more pics, feel free to send me an email. \n\nI am going to be picky about who takes her. So please be sure to read her story before messaging me. \n\n\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T17:41:32.987Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/00808_w3xsZDdpDW_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01717_fIoz9nbSNL_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_kN2cOH2oOzw_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_fl6FAHrNQoQ_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_grTlUsMakT3_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00f0f_bD4bsb9dbA6_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00G0G_7qk5fRjS9cs_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00d0d_6JQx0UABpYz_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00E0E_iBAaWkBsVbB_600x450.jpg"],"$$hashKey":"0E9"}]

It features the advanced decoding circuitry (Dolby Digital, Pro Logic II, EX, DTS Digital Surround, Matrix 6, Neo:6) required to provide high-quality audio with extreme accuracy. It also uses integrated amplifiers to deliver approximately 110W to each channel, and Yamaha's proprietary Tri-Field Processing engine to ensure every Decibel is optimized for a true movie-theater experience. In fact, many reviewers have pointed out that the RX-V2300 produces high-quality audio right out the box-without any adjusted settings. However, the on-screen display (described as a bit complicated) offers several key functionalities for even better audio, including all-channel stereo DSP for a 6-speaker system, virtual cinema dsp for a two-stereo setup, and silent cinema specifically for 2-channel headphones. Additional features include an onboard tuner, an RS-232 interface for connecting to multi-room controllers, and downscaling-conversion (s-video to composite) for switching between sources without having to adjust inputs on the TV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T18:05:05.798Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/01212_2rQDS2Q04FP_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00u0u_PuuBtSYxtP_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01717_70AUKDPn1yk_600x450.jpg"],"$$hashKey":"0BZ"},{"_id":"53e26e51c1361800008300a5","name":"HDTV's - Let The \"New Year\" Begin With A \"Big Screen\" TV!!

This apartment is very new; I am the first person to live here since it was built, about 1 year. \n\nIt's a great apartment with very private views --- the balcony faces the backside parking lot and bedroom windows face the awesome trail behind Umbria apartments. So this means you don't see into other people's apartments, and no apartments can see into yours.\n\nGreat neighbors (very, very quiet) and just an amazing place to live. If I wasn't moving into a home I would stay here.\n\nThrough the leasing office the apartment is currently listed at $1795 which is A HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE than my current lease, $1695. This is a great deal; you save $100 a month for a great apartment, and there is about 10 months left on the lease.\n\n\nRESIDENCE FEATURES\nPrivate garage w/ remote, some with direct access*\nHardwood-style flooring throughout entry, kitchen, living & dining room\nFully-equipped kitchens with refrigerator with ice-maker, microwave, oven & dishwasher\nQuartz Stone countertops in kitchen and bath\nKitchen w/ white shaker panel cabinetry w/ rod pulls & recessed lighting\nIn home washer/dryer\n2\" Mini blinds\nWalk-In closets* or mirrored closet doors\nHigh-efficiency central heating /air conditioning\nIn-home Alarm System w/optional monitoring\nDigital/Cable TV Ready\nWired for High Speed Internet/multiple phone lines\nSmoke-free residences*\nPet friendly with dogs up to 21 inches welcome*\n\nCOMMUNITY AMENITIES\nResort-style saltwater pool, spa, poolside cabanas\nOutdoor fireplace & several BBQ areas\nWi-Fi Access in common areas*\nInternet Café with access to a MacBook, open lounging, and a multi-function printer\nSpacious clubroom with gourmet kitchen, pool table, shuffle board, plasma TV and outdoor terrace w/ dining tables\nCardio Theater fitness center with free weights and strength equipment with 24 hour access\nAccess to future community park will include ball fields, tennis/basketball courts & tot lot\nCentrally located to Irvine biking trails\n* In select floor plans/residences\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T17:46:27.078Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_3qsIZ5md5Ja_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01414_ceKKS2ToKIg_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_k8JTgqFgZpM_600x450.jpg"],"$$hashKey":"076"},{"_id":"53e269f3df4a4a000043660e","name":"Taking Reservations for Spring 2015 Semester","weblink":"http://orangecounty.craigslist.org//apa/4606020781.html","price":"$1300","category":"Apartment","detail":"\n        University Crossings Apartments, managed by AMC\n2404 Nutwood Avenue\nFullerton, CA 92831\n show contact info\n\n\n\nOur residents have full access and are encouraged to take advantage of our Tropical Style Pool with Fire Pit and Music, State of the art Fitness Center, Business Lounge, and Free Wi-Fi in our clubhouse. \n\nBrand new cabinets, kitchen appliance package, fully renovated and more. \n\nApartment Features\n* Air Conditioning\n* Linen Closet\n* Vertical Blinds\n* Refrigerator, Microwave, Dishwasher & Gas Stove\n* Roommate Friendly Floor Plan\n* Pre-wired for internet and cable\n* Ceiling Fan\n\n[#1116622]\n\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T17:46:27.078Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_3wEdf5dsygT_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00v0v_2fEsMLard2_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00202_ka4vLcbq9Xi_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00s0s_kcEgoeqTTLt_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00000_jMngluPUf2t_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00T0T_lRvDiYulIu_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00D0D_h63QecUCRzR_600x450.jpg"],"$$hashKey":"077"},{"_id":"53e269f3df4a4a000043660b","name":"Great Studio Available in Sunny Mission Viejo!

Both are roughly 5.5 - 6 years old. Duncan is a very playful, happy little boy who is anxious to get as much attention as he possibly can. He's hard to resist, trust us on that. Blackberry is super sweet and playful, however she can be a bit shy at first until she gets to know you and a level of trust is established. Based on her body type, she looks like a Belgian hare. Watching them snuggle and play together is a joy, and their antics will have you laughing.

We make every effort to ensure the rabbits are rescued from these local county and city shelters so they won't be destroyed.\nWe care for and foster abandoned, neglected, abused, ill and injured domestic rabbits in a loving, stable, clean environment and provide quality nutrition and the necessary veterinary exams and medical care before a good home can be found.\n\nThe Sweetpea Foundation carefully screens potential adopters to ensure the living environment is suitable and that the rabbit(s) will be adopted into a loving, permanent home. We accomplish this via our web site, through referrals and by holding adoption events at pet stores such as PETCO and PetSmart.  Additionally, we post profiles of the adoptable rabbits on web sites such as Petfinder.com and BunSpace.com. The Sweetpea Foundation makes every effort to educate adopting and fostering families about the care of rabbits. We also provide information on proper diet, housing, the importance of spaying, neutering and other necessary medical care.\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T17:41:32.994Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/00I0I_6N4W1unaK5k_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00t0t_7W4Jaw08pVR_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01313_2Tn0hLvIYtp_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01010_4xRO77HLrkT_600x450.jpg"],"$$hashKey":"0DQ"},{"_id":"53e268cc95d55f0000c2c8b6","name":"Horned Lizard","weblink":"http://orangecounty.craigslist.org//pet/4605101417.html","price":"","category":"Pet","email":"whfwd-4605101417@comm.craigslist.org","detail":"\n         Horned Toad Lizard are squirt blood from their eyes directly into a preys eyes. have limited availability for $75. they live in the dessert environment which makes them easy to care for.

","weblink":"http://orangecounty.craigslist.org//pet/4605252852.html","price":"","category":"Pet","email":"9gmw4-4605252852@comm.craigslist.org","detail":"\n        I am sad to say, my little lady (Prissy) needs a new home. I have had her since I was 18 and she was a puppy (I am now 26) and she was the best little companion ever. I had just moved out and needed a friend. I found her living in a room with 3 other toy breeds destroying a roommates room. I \"requested\" she was given to me. She was my best friend. Prissy went everywhere with me. I even had her trained to hop in a litter box and use the bathroom on a puppy pad while I was at work.\n\nA few years later, I was moving out of California and was having difficulty bringing her. This happened to be around the time my families chihuahua had been put down due to old age. So I gave her to my little brother who was very sad about loosing his dog. This way I would still be able to see her and know she is being taken care of. \n\nShe stayed with my family for about 5 years. They fell in love with her (especially my little brother). She was spoiled and given soft food and table scraps (causing her to get major build up and a rotten mouth). She had also gained a few pounds (which for her tiny size is very noticeable).\n\nIn the middle of those 5 years, my parents ended up getting a divorce and poor little Prissy went from having a house with her own backyard, to a small 2 bedroom apartment. She didn't understand what was going on. She went from having a back yard to run in and out of all day to use the bathroom, to being confined to a small apartment, waiting for someone to come home from work or school to take her out. Naturally, this didn't work out too well. \n\nPrissy ended up using the bathroom all over the apartment and becoming hyper sensitive to every noise she heard outside, causing her to bark. I got a call saying they couldn't deal with her any more. So of course I came and got her. \n\nI got her eating right and back to a healthy weight, as well as using puppy pads while I was at work. She seemed to be getting back on track (despite her new barking habit). I was happy to have her back. She is the sweetest little thing. Loves to just cuddle up in your lap or press her body against your face requesting kisses. I quickly noticed how bad her breath was. \n\nWhen I took her to the vet, they told me that pretty much all her teeth are rotten. She would need to be put under anesthesia and have her teeth cleaned and most of her teeth would fall out during the process. The vet said it was due to years of her eating soft food and table scraps at my families house. I felt horrible for her. They told me it would be around $400 for the whole procedure. I did not have the money. Couple weeks later, she ended up rupturing an anal gland. I ended up having to spend $250 for medication and diapers to keep it sanitary. \n\nI don't know what is going on with her, but she has again stopped using puppy pads. I take her out and she uses the bathroom numerous times, but still comes inside and finds a corner to pee in. I don't get it. Maybe she is just getting old? Or since she is back to living in a house, she forgets where the puppy pads are? I don't know. When we lived in an apartment, she had no problem using the puppy pads. She also barks whenever she hears another dog outside or a person talking. My neighbors are beginning to complain. \n\nI love this lil lady so much, but I have come to the conclusion that it might be best for her to find a new home. Preferably a single older person with no kids and has time to be home with her the majority of the day so she has someone to cuddle and take her out. She was kept in solitary confinement for so many years with my family, that she now is very easily excited when being walked and wants to run after any and everything. She is a very spry little old lady. Does not act at all like a middle aged dog. She is constantly wanting to run and play when she is not cuddled up with you on the couch. You would think she was still a puppy the way she runs and plays. \n\n\n\n\n\nShe just needs someone who is calm and lives a quiet life somewhere with little to no noise. She would be perfect for and elderly woman in need of a companion. She is full of love and deserves a nice quiet life with someone who can take care of her teeth and give her tons of love and affection. She is about 8 years old (and I'm sure will live to be at least 16), and about 3lbs. Your hand is about the size of her whole body. She is a healthy little playful girl with a sassy attitude. At first, she doesn't seem to like company, but after they have sat down she is fine. She seems to feel intimidated when people are standing. She isn't aggressive, just talkative. Prissy is fixed as well. \n\nHer breed is pretty rare. Everyone thinks she is a chihuahua/min pin. But through research, I found out she is a Russian toy terrier. \n\nI am asking a small rehoming fee (100) so I feel confident in knowing you would be able to take care of her and her needs as she gets older. As of now, all she needs is her teethe removed. Other than that, she has the body and mind of a puppy. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read Prissy's story. If you would like to know anything else, or want more pics, feel free to send me an email. \n\nI am going to be picky about who takes her. So please be sure to read her story before messaging me. \n\n\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T17:41:32.987Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/00808_w3xsZDdpDW_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01717_fIoz9nbSNL_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_kN2cOH2oOzw_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_fl6FAHrNQoQ_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_grTlUsMakT3_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00f0f_bD4bsb9dbA6_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00G0G_7qk5fRjS9cs_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00d0d_6JQx0UABpYz_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00E0E_iBAaWkBsVbB_600x450.jpg"],"$$hashKey":"0E9"},{"_id":"53e2f2a7ed225a1602d5f05c","name":"test","weblink":"none","price":"$300","category":"Furniture","email":"rodch100@mail.chapman.edu","detail":"test","location":"orange","source":"yardsale","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-07T03:29:43.070Z","image":["http://topcars.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/businessmanager/no-image-available2.jpg"],"$$hashKey":"0BS"},{"_id":"53e2716254de9f000061d21e","name":"MUST SEE!!

It features the advanced decoding circuitry (Dolby Digital, Pro Logic II, EX, DTS Digital Surround, Matrix 6, Neo:6) required to provide high-quality audio with extreme accuracy. It also uses integrated amplifiers to deliver approximately 110W to each channel, and Yamaha's proprietary Tri-Field Processing engine to ensure every Decibel is optimized for a true movie-theater experience. In fact, many reviewers have pointed out that the RX-V2300 produces high-quality audio right out the box-without any adjusted settings. However, the on-screen display (described as a bit complicated) offers several key functionalities for even better audio, including all-channel stereo DSP for a 6-speaker system, virtual cinema dsp for a two-stereo setup, and silent cinema specifically for 2-channel headphones. Additional features include an onboard tuner, an RS-232 interface for connecting to multi-room controllers, and downscaling-conversion (s-video to composite) for switching between sources without having to adjust inputs on the TV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T18:05:05.798Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/01212_2rQDS2Q04FP_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00u0u_PuuBtSYxtP_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01717_70AUKDPn1yk_600x450.jpg"],"$$hashKey":"0BZ"},{"_id":"53e26e51c1361800008300a5","name":"HDTV's - Let The \"New Year\" Begin With A \"Big Screen\" TV!!

This apartment is very new; I am the first person to live here since it was built, about 1 year. \n\nIt's a great apartment with very private views --- the balcony faces the backside parking lot and bedroom windows face the awesome trail behind Umbria apartments. So this means you don't see into other people's apartments, and no apartments can see into yours.\n\nGreat neighbors (very, very quiet) and just an amazing place to live. If I wasn't moving into a home I would stay here.\n\nThrough the leasing office the apartment is currently listed at $1795 which is A HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE than my current lease, $1695.

We make every effort to ensure the rabbits are rescued from these local county and city shelters so they won't be destroyed.\nWe care for and foster abandoned, neglected, abused, ill and injured domestic rabbits in a loving, stable, clean environment and provide quality nutrition and the necessary veterinary exams and medical care before a good home can be found.\n\nThe Sweetpea Foundation carefully screens potential adopters to ensure the living environment is suitable and that the rabbit(s) will be adopted into a loving, permanent home. We accomplish this via our web site, through referrals and by holding adoption events at pet stores such as PETCO and PetSmart.  Additionally, we post profiles of the adoptable rabbits on web sites such as Petfinder.com and BunSpace.com. The Sweetpea Foundation makes every effort to educate adopting and fostering families about the care of rabbits. We also provide information on proper diet, housing, the importance of spaying, neutering and other necessary medical care.\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T17:41:32.994Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/00I0I_6N4W1unaK5k_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00t0t_7W4Jaw08pVR_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01313_2Tn0hLvIYtp_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01010_4xRO77HLrkT_600x450.jpg"]},{"_id":"53e268cc95d55f0000c2c8b6","name":"Horned Lizard","weblink":"http://orangecounty.craigslist.org//pet/4605101417.html","price":"","category":"Pet","email":"whfwd-4605101417@comm.craigslist.org","detail":"\n         Horned Toad Lizard are squirt blood from their eyes directly into a preys eyes. have limited availability for $75. they live in the dessert environment which makes them easy to care for.

","weblink":"http://orangecounty.craigslist.org//pet/4605252852.html","price":"","category":"Pet","email":"9gmw4-4605252852@comm.craigslist.org","detail":"\n        I am sad to say, my little lady (Prissy) needs a new home. I have had her since I was 18 and she was a puppy (I am now 26) and she was the best little companion ever. I had just moved out and needed a friend. I found her living in a room with 3 other toy breeds destroying a roommates room. I \"requested\" she was given to me. She was my best friend. Prissy went everywhere with me. I even had her trained to hop in a litter box and use the bathroom on a puppy pad while I was at work.\n\nA few years later, I was moving out of California and was having difficulty bringing her. This happened to be around the time my families chihuahua had been put down due to old age. So I gave her to my little brother who was very sad about loosing his dog. This way I would still be able to see her and know she is being taken care of. \n\nShe stayed with my family for about 5 years. They fell in love with her (especially my little brother). She was spoiled and given soft food and table scraps (causing her to get major build up and a rotten mouth). She had also gained a few pounds (which for her tiny size is very noticeable).\n\nIn the middle of those 5 years, my parents ended up getting a divorce and poor little Prissy went from having a house with her own backyard, to a small 2 bedroom apartment. She didn't understand what was going on. She went from having a back yard to run in and out of all day to use the bathroom, to being confined to a small apartment, waiting for someone to come home from work or school to take her out. Naturally, this didn't work out too well. \n\nPrissy ended up using the bathroom all over the apartment and becoming hyper sensitive to every noise she heard outside, causing her to bark. I got a call saying they couldn't deal with her any more. So of course I came and got her. \n\nI got her eating right and back to a healthy weight, as well as using puppy pads while I was at work. She seemed to be getting back on track (despite her new barking habit). I was happy to have her back. She is the sweetest little thing. Loves to just cuddle up in your lap or press her body against your face requesting kisses. I quickly noticed how bad her breath was. \n\nWhen I took her to the vet, they told me that pretty much all her teeth are rotten. She would need to be put under anesthesia and have her teeth cleaned and most of her teeth would fall out during the process. The vet said it was due to years of her eating soft food and table scraps at my families house. I felt horrible for her. They told me it would be around $400 for the whole procedure. I did not have the money. Couple weeks later, she ended up rupturing an anal gland. I ended up having to spend $250 for medication and diapers to keep it sanitary. \n\nI don't know what is going on with her, but she has again stopped using puppy pads. I take her out and she uses the bathroom numerous times, but still comes inside and finds a corner to pee in. I don't get it. Maybe she is just getting old? Or since she is back to living in a house, she forgets where the puppy pads are? I don't know. When we lived in an apartment, she had no problem using the puppy pads. She also barks whenever she hears another dog outside or a person talking. My neighbors are beginning to complain. \n\nI love this lil lady so much, but I have come to the conclusion that it might be best for her to find a new home. Preferably a single older person with no kids and has time to be home with her the majority of the day so she has someone to cuddle and take her out. She was kept in solitary confinement for so many years with my family, that she now is very easily excited when being walked and wants to run after any and everything. She is a very spry little old lady. Does not act at all like a middle aged dog. She is constantly wanting to run and play when she is not cuddled up with you on the couch. You would think she was still a puppy the way she runs and plays. \n\n\n\n\n\nShe just needs someone who is calm and lives a quiet life somewhere with little to no noise. She would be perfect for and elderly woman in need of a companion. She is full of love and deserves a nice quiet life with someone who can take care of her teeth and give her tons of love and affection. She is about 8 years old (and I'm sure will live to be at least 16), and about 3lbs. Your hand is about the size of her whole body. She is a healthy little playful girl with a sassy attitude. At first, she doesn't seem to like company, but after they have sat down she is fine. She seems to feel intimidated when people are standing. She isn't aggressive, just talkative. Prissy is fixed as well. \n\nHer breed is pretty rare. Everyone thinks she is a chihuahua/min pin. But through research, I found out she is a Russian toy terrier. \n\nI am asking a small rehoming fee (100) so I feel confident in knowing you would be able to take care of her and her needs as she gets older. As of now, all she needs is her teethe removed. Other than that, she has the body and mind of a puppy. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read Prissy's story. If you would like to know anything else, or want more pics, feel free to send me an email. \n\nI am going to be picky about who takes her. So please be sure to read her story before messaging me. \n\n\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T17:41:32.987Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/00808_w3xsZDdpDW_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01717_fIoz9nbSNL_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_kN2cOH2oOzw_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_fl6FAHrNQoQ_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_grTlUsMakT3_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00f0f_bD4bsb9dbA6_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00G0G_7qk5fRjS9cs_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00d0d_6JQx0UABpYz_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00E0E_iBAaWkBsVbB_600x450.jpg"]},{"_id":"53e2f2a7ed225a1602d5f05c","name":"test","weblink":"none","price":"$300","category":"Furniture","email":"rodch100@mail.chapman.edu","detail":"test","location":"orange","source":"yardsale","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-07T03:29:43.070Z","image":["http://topcars.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/businessmanager/no-image-available2.jpg"]},{"_id":"53e2716254de9f000061d21e","name":"MUST SEE!!

It features the advanced decoding circuitry (Dolby Digital, Pro Logic II, EX, DTS Digital Surround, Matrix 6, Neo:6) required to provide high-quality audio with extreme accuracy. It also uses integrated amplifiers to deliver approximately 110W to each channel, and Yamaha's proprietary Tri-Field Processing engine to ensure every Decibel is optimized for a true movie-theater experience. In fact, many reviewers have pointed out that the RX-V2300 produces high-quality audio right out the box-without any adjusted settings. However, the on-screen display (described as a bit complicated) offers several key functionalities for even better audio, including all-channel stereo DSP for a 6-speaker system, virtual cinema dsp for a two-stereo setup, and silent cinema specifically for 2-channel headphones. Additional features include an onboard tuner, an RS-232 interface for connecting to multi-room controllers, and downscaling-conversion (s-video to composite) for switching between sources without having to adjust inputs on the TV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T18:05:05.798Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/01212_2rQDS2Q04FP_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00u0u_PuuBtSYxtP_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01717_70AUKDPn1yk_600x450.jpg"]},{"_id":"53e26e51c1361800008300a5","name":"HDTV's - Let The \"New Year\" Begin With A \"Big Screen\" TV!!

This apartment is very new; I am the first person to live here since it was built, about 1 year. \n\nIt's a great apartment with very private views --- the balcony faces the backside parking lot and bedroom windows face the awesome trail behind Umbria apartments. So this means you don't see into other people's apartments, and no apartments can see into yours.\n\nGreat neighbors (very, very quiet) and just an amazing place to live. If I wasn't moving into a home I would stay here.\n\nThrough the leasing office the apartment is currently listed at $1795 which is A HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE than my current lease, $1695. This is a great deal; you save $100 a month for a great apartment, and there is about 10 months left on the lease.\n\n\nRESIDENCE FEATURES\nPrivate garage w/ remote, some with direct access*\nHardwood-style flooring throughout entry, kitchen, living & dining room\nFully-equipped kitchens with refrigerator with ice-maker, microwave, oven & dishwasher\nQuartz Stone countertops in kitchen and bath\nKitchen w/ white shaker panel cabinetry w/ rod pulls & recessed lighting\nIn home washer/dryer\n2\" Mini blinds\nWalk-In closets* or mirrored closet doors\nHigh-efficiency central heating /air conditioning\nIn-home Alarm System w/optional monitoring\nDigital/Cable TV Ready\nWired for High Speed Internet/multiple phone lines\nSmoke-free residences*\nPet friendly with dogs up to 21 inches welcome*\n\nCOMMUNITY AMENITIES\nResort-style saltwater pool, spa, poolside cabanas\nOutdoor fireplace & several BBQ areas\nWi-Fi Access in common areas*\nInternet Café with access to a MacBook, open lounging, and a multi-function printer\nSpacious clubroom with gourmet kitchen, pool table, shuffle board, plasma TV and outdoor terrace w/ dining tables\nCardio Theater fitness center with free weights and strength equipment with 24 hour access\nAccess to future community park will include ball fields, tennis/basketball courts & tot lot\nCentrally located to Irvine biking trails\n* In select floor plans/residences\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T17:46:27.078Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_3qsIZ5md5Ja_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01414_ceKKS2ToKIg_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_k8JTgqFgZpM_600x450.jpg"],"$$hashKey":"1R0"},{"_id":"53e269f3df4a4a000043660e","name":"Taking Reservations for Spring 2015 Semester","weblink":"http://orangecounty.craigslist.org//apa/4606020781.html","price":"$1300","category":"Apartment","detail":"\n        University Crossings Apartments, managed by AMC\n2404 Nutwood Avenue\nFullerton, CA 92831\n show contact info\n\n\n\nOur residents have full access and are encouraged to take advantage of our Tropical Style Pool with Fire Pit and Music, State of the art Fitness Center, Business Lounge, and Free Wi-Fi in our clubhouse. \n\nBrand new cabinets, kitchen appliance package, fully renovated and more. \n\nApartment Features\n* Air Conditioning\n* Linen Closet\n* Vertical Blinds\n* Refrigerator, Microwave, Dishwasher & Gas Stove\n* Roommate Friendly Floor Plan\n* Pre-wired for internet and cable\n* Ceiling Fan\n\n[#1116622]\n\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T17:46:27.078Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_3wEdf5dsygT_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00v0v_2fEsMLard2_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00202_ka4vLcbq9Xi_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00s0s_kcEgoeqTTLt_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00000_jMngluPUf2t_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00T0T_lRvDiYulIu_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00D0D_h63QecUCRzR_600x450.jpg"],"$$hashKey":"1QC"},{"_id":"53e269f3df4a4a000043660b","name":"Great Studio Available in Sunny Mission Viejo!

We make every effort to ensure the rabbits are rescued from these local county and city shelters so they won't be destroyed.\nWe care for and foster abandoned, neglected, abused, ill and injured domestic rabbits in a loving, stable, clean environment and provide quality nutrition and the necessary veterinary exams and medical care before a good home can be found.\n\nThe Sweetpea Foundation carefully screens potential adopters to ensure the living environment is suitable and that the rabbit(s) will be adopted into a loving, permanent home. We accomplish this via our web site, through referrals and by holding adoption events at pet stores such as PETCO and PetSmart.  Additionally, we post profiles of the adoptable rabbits on web sites such as Petfinder.com and BunSpace.com. The Sweetpea Foundation makes every effort to educate adopting and fostering families about the care of rabbits. We also provide information on proper diet, housing, the importance of spaying, neutering and other necessary medical care.\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T17:41:32.994Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/00I0I_6N4W1unaK5k_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00t0t_7W4Jaw08pVR_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01313_2Tn0hLvIYtp_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01010_4xRO77HLrkT_600x450.jpg"],"$$hashKey":"1RB"},{"_id":"53e268cc95d55f0000c2c8b6","name":"Horned Lizard","weblink":"http://orangecounty.craigslist.org//pet/4605101417.html","price":"","category":"Pet","email":"whfwd-4605101417@comm.craigslist.org","detail":"\n         Horned Toad Lizard are squirt blood from their eyes directly into a preys eyes. have limited availability for $75. they live in the dessert environment which makes them easy to care for.

","weblink":"http://orangecounty.craigslist.org//pet/4605252852.html","price":"","category":"Pet","email":"9gmw4-4605252852@comm.craigslist.org","detail":"\n        I am sad to say, my little lady (Prissy) needs a new home. I have had her since I was 18 and she was a puppy (I am now 26) and she was the best little companion ever. I had just moved out and needed a friend. I found her living in a room with 3 other toy breeds destroying a roommates room. I \"requested\" she was given to me. She was my best friend. Prissy went everywhere with me. I even had her trained to hop in a litter box and use the bathroom on a puppy pad while I was at work.\n\nA few years later, I was moving out of California and was having difficulty bringing her. This happened to be around the time my families chihuahua had been put down due to old age. So I gave her to my little brother who was very sad about loosing his dog. This way I would still be able to see her and know she is being taken care of. \n\nShe stayed with my family for about 5 years. They fell in love with her (especially my little brother). She was spoiled and given soft food and table scraps (causing her to get major build up and a rotten mouth). She had also gained a few pounds (which for her tiny size is very noticeable).\n\nIn the middle of those 5 years, my parents ended up getting a divorce and poor little Prissy went from having a house with her own backyard, to a small 2 bedroom apartment. She didn't understand what was going on. She went from having a back yard to run in and out of all day to use the bathroom, to being confined to a small apartment, waiting for someone to come home from work or school to take her out. Naturally, this didn't work out too well. \n\nPrissy ended up using the bathroom all over the apartment and becoming hyper sensitive to every noise she heard outside, causing her to bark. I got a call saying they couldn't deal with her any more. So of course I came and got her. \n\nI got her eating right and back to a healthy weight, as well as using puppy pads while I was at work. She seemed to be getting back on track (despite her new barking habit). I was happy to have her back. She is the sweetest little thing. Loves to just cuddle up in your lap or press her body against your face requesting kisses. I quickly noticed how bad her breath was. \n\nWhen I took her to the vet, they told me that pretty much all her teeth are rotten. She would need to be put under anesthesia and have her teeth cleaned and most of her teeth would fall out during the process. The vet said it was due to years of her eating soft food and table scraps at my families house. I felt horrible for her. They told me it would be around $400 for the whole procedure. I did not have the money. Couple weeks later, she ended up rupturing an anal gland. I ended up having to spend $250 for medication and diapers to keep it sanitary. \n\nI don't know what is going on with her, but she has again stopped using puppy pads. I take her out and she uses the bathroom numerous times, but still comes inside and finds a corner to pee in. I don't get it. Maybe she is just getting old? Or since she is back to living in a house, she forgets where the puppy pads are? I don't know. When we lived in an apartment, she had no problem using the puppy pads. She also barks whenever she hears another dog outside or a person talking. My neighbors are beginning to complain. \n\nI love this lil lady so much, but I have come to the conclusion that it might be best for her to find a new home. Preferably a single older person with no kids and has time to be home with her the majority of the day so she has someone to cuddle and take her out. She was kept in solitary confinement for so many years with my family, that she now is very easily excited when being walked and wants to run after any and everything. She is a very spry little old lady. Does not act at all like a middle aged dog. She is constantly wanting to run and play when she is not cuddled up with you on the couch. You would think she was still a puppy the way she runs and plays. \n\n\n\n\n\nShe just needs someone who is calm and lives a quiet life somewhere with little to no noise. She would be perfect for and elderly woman in need of a companion. She is full of love and deserves a nice quiet life with someone who can take care of her teeth and give her tons of love and affection. She is about 8 years old (and I'm sure will live to be at least 16), and about 3lbs. Your hand is about the size of her whole body. She is a healthy little playful girl with a sassy attitude. At first, she doesn't seem to like company, but after they have sat down she is fine. She seems to feel intimidated when people are standing. She isn't aggressive, just talkative. Prissy is fixed as well. \n\nHer breed is pretty rare. Everyone thinks she is a chihuahua/min pin. But through research, I found out she is a Russian toy terrier. \n\nI am asking a small rehoming fee (100) so I feel confident in knowing you would be able to take care of her and her needs as she gets older. As of now, all she needs is her teethe removed. Other than that, she has the body and mind of a puppy. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read Prissy's story. If you would like to know anything else, or want more pics, feel free to send me an email. \n\nI am going to be picky about who takes her. So please be sure to read her story before messaging me. \n\n\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T17:41:32.987Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/00808_w3xsZDdpDW_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01717_fIoz9nbSNL_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_kN2cOH2oOzw_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_fl6FAHrNQoQ_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_grTlUsMakT3_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00f0f_bD4bsb9dbA6_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00G0G_7qk5fRjS9cs_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00d0d_6JQx0UABpYz_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00E0E_iBAaWkBsVbB_600x450.jpg"],"$$hashKey":"1RE"},{"_id":"53e2f2a7ed225a1602d5f05c","name":"test","weblink":"none","price":"$300","category":"Furniture","email":"rodch100@mail.chapman.edu","detail":"test","location":"orange","source":"yardsale","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-07T03:29:43.070Z","image":["http://topcars.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/businessmanager/no-image-available2.jpg"],"$$hashKey":"1R9"},{"_id":"53e2716254de9f000061d21e","name":"MUST SEE!!

It features the advanced decoding circuitry (Dolby Digital, Pro Logic II, EX, DTS Digital Surround, Matrix 6, Neo:6) required to provide high-quality audio with extreme accuracy. It also uses integrated amplifiers to deliver approximately 110W to each channel, and Yamaha's proprietary Tri-Field Processing engine to ensure every Decibel is optimized for a true movie-theater experience. In fact, many reviewers have pointed out that the RX-V2300 produces high-quality audio right out the box-without any adjusted settings. However, the on-screen display (described as a bit complicated) offers several key functionalities for even better audio, including all-channel stereo DSP for a 6-speaker system, virtual cinema dsp for a two-stereo setup, and silent cinema specifically for 2-channel headphones. Additional features include an onboard tuner, an RS-232 interface for connecting to multi-room controllers, and downscaling-conversion (s-video to composite) for switching between sources without having to adjust inputs on the TV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T18:05:05.798Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/01212_2rQDS2Q04FP_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00u0u_PuuBtSYxtP_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01717_70AUKDPn1yk_600x450.jpg"],"$$hashKey":"1NU"},{"_id":"53e26e51c1361800008300a5","name":"HDTV's - Let The \"New Year\" Begin With A \"Big Screen\" TV!!

This apartment is very new; I am the first person to live here since it was built, about 1 year. \n\nIt's a great apartment with very private views --- the balcony faces the backside parking lot and bedroom windows face the awesome trail behind Umbria apartments.

If I wasn't moving into a home I would stay here.\n\nThrough the leasing office the apartment is currently listed at $1795 which is A HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE than my current lease, $1695.

Both are roughly 5.5 - 6 years old. Duncan is a very playful, happy little boy who is anxious to get as much attention as he possibly can. He's hard to resist, trust us on that. Blackberry is super sweet and playful, however she can be a bit shy at first until she gets to know you and a level of trust is established. Based on her body type, she looks like a Belgian hare. Watching them snuggle and play together is a joy, and their antics will have you laughing.

We make every effort to ensure the rabbits are rescued from these local county and city shelters so they won't be destroyed.\nWe care for and foster abandoned, neglected, abused, ill and injured domestic rabbits in a loving, stable, clean environment and provide quality nutrition and the necessary veterinary exams and medical care before a good home can be found.\n\nThe Sweetpea Foundation carefully screens potential adopters to ensure the living environment is suitable and that the rabbit(s) will be adopted into a loving, permanent home. We accomplish this via our web site, through referrals and by holding adoption events at pet stores such as PETCO and PetSmart.

It features the advanced decoding circuitry (Dolby Digital, Pro Logic II, EX, DTS Digital Surround, Matrix 6, Neo:6) required to provide high-quality audio with extreme accuracy. It also uses integrated amplifiers to deliver approximately 110W to each channel, and Yamaha's proprietary Tri-Field Processing engine to ensure every Decibel is optimized for a true movie-theater experience. In fact, many reviewers have pointed out that the RX-V2300 produces high-quality audio right out the box-without any adjusted settings. However, the on-screen display (described as a bit complicated) offers several key functionalities for even better audio, including all-channel stereo DSP for a 6-speaker system, virtual cinema dsp for a two-stereo setup, and silent cinema specifically for 2-channel headphones. Additional features include an onboard tuner, an RS-232 interface for connecting to multi-room controllers, and downscaling-conversion (s-video to composite) for switching between sources without having to adjust inputs on the TV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    ","location":"orange","source":"craiglist","__v":0,"date":"2014-08-06T18:05:05.798Z","image":["http://images.craigslist.org/01212_2rQDS2Q04FP_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/00u0u_PuuBtSYxtP_600x450.jpg","http://images.craigslist.org/01717_70AUKDPn1yk_600x450.jpg"]},{"_id":"53e26e51c1361800008300a5","name":"HDTV's - Let The \"New Year\" Begin With A \"Big Screen\" TV!!
